&lt;p&gt;The air ticket from Guangzhou to Haikou is 50% cheaper than that to Sanya on average, while the bullet train from Haikou to Sanya only costs 80 yuan and takes two hours. For us working class, it is a little bit to save a little, and there is no doubt that we will transfer from Haikou. I didnâ€™t do my homework at first, thinking that Haikou Airport had to take a taxi to Haikou Railway Station to take a train. When I arrived at the airport, I realized that the train station was in the airport. As the top ten airports in the country, Haikou competed with Sanya for business. One feature is that the structure of this train station is completely a subway station model, not only the lines are underground, but also the platform screen door is also the design method of the subway station.&lt;/p&gt;
