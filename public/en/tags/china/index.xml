&lt;p&gt;Dizzy in the afternoon, I stood in front of the bookshelf and spent more than half an hour flipping through Russell&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;China Question&amp;rdquo;, excerpted two pages,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to be convinced by Russell&amp;rsquo;s vision in 1922. Most of the Chinese problems he predicted happened later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And mostly impartial, to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among them are a few comparative viewpoints, which I have known before, and let me deepen my impression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At that time, there was no big gap between China and the West in terms of morality and ethics. The biggest gap between China and the UK was science and technology;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Chinese learn from the West, most of them only care about morality, ethics, social value, etc., and pursue the pleasure of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joy of knowledge is considered by the Chinese as the door to wisdom;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westerners come to China only for three things: fighting wars, making money, and preaching;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of Japanese learning from the West is to enrich the country and strengthen the army;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese think that they are the best nation, and this point of view is shown to the world through the behavior of the Japanese,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the only exception to the &amp;ldquo;white-yellow-black&amp;rdquo; theory of the superiority and inferiority of races;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three major weaknesses of Chinese people: greed, cowardice, and indifference;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fragility of China&amp;rsquo;s coastal defense before the Sino-Japanese War of 1899-1895 was due to the corruption of Japanese interests;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China needs to save itself, not rely on foreigners!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is only a small part of my consciousness. This book still has a very friendly attitude towards China, but it is towards the West,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is more criticized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many historical facts in it are now clear, its predictability is really worth studying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
