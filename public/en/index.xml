        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/listening-to-the-teachings-of-a-university-professor-again-after-16-years/university.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Listening to the teachings of a university professor again after 16 years" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 13th, the Ministry of Education issued a public notice, indicating its intention to agree to the proposal by Foshan University of Science and Technology to change its name to Foshan University. This is the fifth renaming application by Foshan University of Science and Technology, and it seems that the matter has finally been settled. Initially, at the end of 2019, during the third renaming application to “Guangdong University of Science and Technology,” it seemed almost certain, as the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education had already publicized it and submitted it to the Ministry of Education for approval. However, due to the impact of the pandemic, the renaming inspection originally planned for the spring of 2020 did not proceed as scheduled, and this delay lasted for three years. By 2023, the Ministry of Education had introduced new naming rules for universities, making it almost impossible for Foshan University of Science and Technology to be approved for renaming as Guangdong University of Science and Technology. Consequently, when resubmitting the application, the school proposed the name “Foshan University,” which was actually one of the school’s previous names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-sudden-arrangement-for-a-class-reunion&#34;&gt;A sudden arrangement for a class reunion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a stone stirring up a thousand ripples, the familiar Foshan University was finally returning, reviving the long-silent class and alumni groups. Consequently, a classmate proposed a weekend dinner gathering to celebrate this wonderful event. Due to the sudden nature of the event, only eight classmates nearby Foshan were able to attend, and one person couldn’t make it to the dinner due to a last-minute matter. However, to everyone’s surprise, what started as a joke in the class group ended up with the classmate who organized the event actually inviting the former dean of the college. This respected dean had also taught our “Jurisprudence” course during the 2007-2008 academic year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening-to-the-teacher-lecture-again&#34;&gt;Listening to the teacher lecture again
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For almost the first three hours of the dinner, it was mostly the teacher talking, or us students asking questions and the teacher answering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-the-teacher-himself&#34;&gt;About the teacher himself
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teacher started with his experiences of traveling abroad after retiring in January this year and talked about his personal journey from starting to teach at Foshan University in 1992, through its renaming to Foshan University of Science and Technology, and the multiple attempts to revert to a university status. Especially after 2017, he shared his own health challenges and how, as a scholar, he conducted interdisciplinary research on his condition, overcame it, and took care of his health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-childrens-education&#34;&gt;About children’s education
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the dinner, the teacher spent a long time talking about his own experiences and those of other teachers at the college in educating their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;he-emphasized-the-current-importance-of-the-high-school-entrance-exam-zhongkao&#34;&gt;He emphasized the current importance of the high school entrance exam (Zhongkao)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which he believes is now more significant than the college entrance exam (Gaokao). Since the late 1970s, the Gaokao has been considered the most important exam in China, with countless people relying on it to change their destinies. However, in recent years, due to the saturation of college enrollment, the university admission rate has approached 90%, and for most students attending ordinary high schools, even if they “lie flat,” they basically have no worries about not being able to attend university. Overall, the importance of the Gaokao is decreasing. But at the same time, due to the “general vocational分流” policy, during the process of entering high school, more than 55% of junior high school students in many places can only attend secondary vocational technical schools after graduation, and it is basically impossible for these schools to progress to ordinary universities. In this situation, if a child’s academic performance is not ideal in primary and junior high school, they may lose the opportunity to attend an ordinary university and can only take the vocational technical university route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;he-talked-about-his-methods-of-educating-his-children&#34;&gt;He talked about his methods of educating his children
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both he and his wife are highly educated, but they also faced difficulties in educating their children. He summed it up with the phrase &lt;strong&gt;“parents are not good at teaching their children (academics).”&lt;/strong&gt; Parents can still play a decisive role in their children’s growth in life and other aspects, but their role in learning is very limited. He emphasized the importance of teachers and schools in improving children’s academic performance and cited a series of examples from his surroundings. He hoped that we would create a relaxed family atmosphere for our children, send them to the best schools within our means, and handle relationships with teachers well. He advised that we should mainly rely on schools and classrooms to enhance our children’s learning ability, rather than relying on family or off-campus tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;he-discussed-the-issue-of-childrens-educational-planning&#34;&gt;He discussed the issue of children’s educational planning.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a law major himself and with his wife studying medicine, he pointed out that fields like law, especially medicine, and computer science are highly competitive and require continuous learning and updating of knowledge to keep up with the times. Even in computer science, it’s quite possible to be unable to compete with younger people in their thirties and forties due to the physical and familial demands that come with age, making it easy to fall behind in the race for new technology. He stressed the importance of guiding children to develop hobbies and interests based on their personalities and interests, rather than just following trends. The teacher has only one daughter, who is almost our age. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree from a top art academy in China, she pursued a master’s degree at a well-ranked university in the United States, and later, a Ph.D. After completing her doctorate, she became a teacher at a domestic art academy and quickly grew to become one of the youngest professors there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-the-development-of-the-university&#34;&gt;About the development of the university
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the earliest faculty members with a doctoral degree in law at our alma mater, the teacher has long served as the university’s legal advisor and is aware of many secrets behind the school’s development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-development-of-a-university-is-inseparable-from-the-help-of-influential-people&#34;&gt;The development of a university is inseparable from the help of influential people.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the course of the development of Foshan University and later Foshan University of Science and Technology, the support of key figures was indispensable. In the early stages, two mayors of Foshan City, Yu Fei and Lu Ruihua, played significant roles. Without the attention and support of these two mayors, Foshan University would not have been established in 1986. &lt;em&gt;(Yu Fei: Served as the Vice-Governor of Guangdong Province but was expelled from the Communist Party in 1998 due to his children’s seeking private interests; Lu Ruihua: Served as the Governor of Guangdong Province. )&lt;/em&gt;
In the last 10 years, Foshan University of Science and Technology has skyrocketed from outside the top 500 national university rankings to 219th nationwide, thanks in large part to the assistance of the former Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, Hu Chunhua. As a member of the Central Political Bureau, Hu Chunhua visited the school three times after 2015, proposed the goal of building Foshan University of Science and Technology into a high-level science and technology university in Guangdong, and the Guangdong provincial government allocated 500 million yuan specifically for support. Since then, the school’s development has entered the fast lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-development-of-a-university-cannot-be-separated-from-government-support&#34;&gt;The development of a university cannot be separated from government support.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since public universities dominate in China, the development of universities is driven by administrative resources, and the richness of these resources determines the height of university development. Decisive factors include the level of education and the allocation of funds, both of which are decided by administrative organs. As a university founded by the Foshan municipal government, Foshan University has inherent shortcomings because, compared to the financial strength of national or provincial governments, a prefecture-level city like Foshan falls far short. Moreover, although Foshan’s economic output ranks among the top 20 in the country, as an ordinary prefecture-level city in the Pearl River Delta, under the three-tier fiscal structure (about 50% of income goes to the central government, and of the remaining 50% tax, another 50% goes to the province, leaving about 25% actually retained), the financial resources that the Foshan municipal government can dispose of are far less than those of first-tier cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, as well as other sub-provincial cities and general provincial capitals. For example, the fiscal budget expenditure for Foshan University of Science and Technology in 2024 is 1.8 billion yuan, while the fiscal budget expenditure for the Foshan municipal government during the same period is 24 billion yuan, accounting for 7.5% of the total. Nearby universities such as Shenzhen University and Southern University of Science and Technology have fiscal expenditures of over 6 billion yuan, which is an amount that the Foshan city government, with a fiscal budget of 24 billion at the city level, cannot afford. Fortunately, Foshan University of Science and Technology is currently not large in scale, and if calculated by the per-student expenditure on funds, it ranks among the top in Guangdong’s higher education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-development-of-a-university-needs-to-go-with-the-flow&#34;&gt;The development of a university needs to go with the flow.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In discussing the school’s development, the teacher specifically mentioned the construction of doctoral programs, which is one of the two biggest projects the school has undertaken in recent years, the other being the “renaming to a university” project. Currently, there are about 400 universities in China with doctoral programs. Although Foshan University of Science and Technology has seen its ranking climb continuously, the lack of a doctoral program has always been a major concern, and this has even led to the university’s president position being vacant for three years. The main reason is that the Foshan municipal government hopes to find an expert at the “Academician” level to serve as the president, and it is almost impossible to find an Academician willing to be the president of a school without a doctoral program. In this round of applying for a doctoral program, the school has put in a great deal of effort, especially the party committee secretary who has used all his skills to advance the discipline construction, focusing on mechanical engineering, a field he is highly proficient in. As of now, the application for a doctoral program has reached the most critical stage. In the list of Guangdong universities applying for doctoral program construction published by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education, Foshan University of Science and Technology’s mechanical engineering doctoral program ranked first among 234 disciplines in 32 universities across the province, and veterinary and animal husbandry programs also ranked among the top five. It can be said that this is the closest the school has been to securing a doctoral program since it became a doctoral degree-granting institution in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-personal-growth&#34;&gt;About personal growth
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his 32 years of work experience, the teacher shared several key aspects that we should focus on during our professional development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;avoid-speaking-ill-of-others-when-they-are-not-present&#34;&gt;Avoid speaking ill of others when they are not present.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teacher emphasized that Chinese society is heavily influenced by personal relationships, and we should never speak ill of others, regardless of how much we may dislike them or have had conflicts with them. Even a decade ago, we might not have fully appreciated the importance of this advice, but today, we deeply agree with it. Numerous examples around us confirm this point. However, as human beings, we have our limitations, and sometimes we inadvertently express our true feelings, leading to unforeseen consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dont-be-too-rigid&#34;&gt;Don’t be too rigid.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teacher cited several examples from his own experience, advising us to be flexible in handling work relationships and not to be overly pedantic or inflexible. Wearing the necessary masks and disguises is essential for self-protection, which is the foundation of growth. Throughout our development, we will encounter various setbacks and unavoidable conflicts of interest, but we should still approach them with a relaxed and optimistic attitude. Harmonious workplace relationships are crucial for our own well-being. We should not view potential competitors as adversaries but rather as companions, as work is only an eight-hour-a-day matter, while life is a lifelong journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;learn-to-be-content-and-embrace-ordinariness&#34;&gt;Learn to be content and embrace ordinariness.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teacher used examples of students and leaders he has helped and supported over the years to advise us that as we enter middle age, we should start to learn satisfaction and contentment, and not overly concern ourselves with personal gains and losses. After all, as we reach middle age, the harmony of the family, the growth of our children, and our health are often more important than personal advancement. Especially within the system, the time most people can shine in their careers typically does not exceed 15 years. In the marathon of life, there can still be two to three decades after retirement. Even if some have held high positions and had power for a time, facing decades of retirement, if there are problems with the family, children, or their own health, it would all have been in vain.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-legal-work-in-law&#34;&gt;About legal work in law
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a senior law professor, the teacher offered some sound advice and suggestions for the work and development of several of us students based on his own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;regarding-judicial-work&#34;&gt;Regarding judicial work.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including myself, two of us present have worked in judicial authorities. Drawing on his long-term experience serving part-time in the National People’s Congress, the teacher offered two suggestions for those of us engaged in judicial work: First, the current workload in judicial authorities is generally high, with many cases and few people, a situation that is expected to persist for a long time, and the reward may not be proportional to the effort. For women, especially, who often have to invest more in family and childcare, choosing a career in the judiciary requires careful consideration. Second, within the judiciary, there is a significant level of internal competition, with a concentration of highly educated individuals, complex factions, and young and female leaders often having higher aspirations. It is important to know one’s limits, avoid confrontation, and advance steadily with modesty and caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;regarding-arbitration-work&#34;&gt;Regarding arbitration work.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the students present works in an arbitration institution. Based on his experience as an arbitrator, the teacher advised that students working in arbitration institutions should strengthen communication with law firms, businesses, and other industry organizations, improve communication skills, and develop a network of contacts. Outside of work, they should continuously study relevant trade laws, international trade management, and arbitration rules to maintain advanced and in-depth professional knowledge. However, he suggested that it might not be necessary to pursue a doctoral degree, as we have all been working for over a decade and have missed the optimal time to advance our careers with a doctoral degree. Moreover, at our age, with the pressures of work and life, the benefits of obtaining a PhD may not be significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;regarding-notary-work&#34;&gt;Regarding notary work.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two students present work in notary institutions. The teacher, based on his experience, put forward several points: First, the notary industry is relatively closed, with a smaller number of notaries among legal professions, and the overall development space is narrow. Second, in recent years, the notary industry has been continuously promoting restructuring, with some notary institutions transitioning from traditional public institutions to social welfare organizations similar to law firms. In this process, the personal networks and channels established become extremely important, as work income will be directly related to the volume of business. Third, the notary industry is closely related to the legal profession, and it is important to pay attention to interactions with lawyers, guiding clients to resolve many common disputes through notarization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;regarding-lawyer-practice&#34;&gt;Regarding lawyer practice.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One student is a practicing lawyer, and the teacher himself has also served as a part-time lawyer, and I also work part-time as a public service lawyer. Because of concerns that continuing to practice law after retirement might affect retirement benefits, the teacher canceled his part-time lawyer’s license upon retirement and did not apply to convert it to a general lawyer’s practice certificate. The teacher offered several suggestions for legal practice, including the importance of maintaining client relationships, how to expand one’s network and case sources, and the need for lifelong learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;regarding-corporate-work&#34;&gt;Regarding corporate work.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two students work in central enterprises and large private enterprises in the IT and internet industry. As they are both female and have personal or family health issues, the teacher suggested that they should pay attention to their own and their family’s health while maintaining a positive attitude towards life and a proactive learning mindset. They should keep abreast of industry trends and maintain their level of expertise in law, seeking development opportunities through their comparative advantages in non-legal work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;regarding-work-within-the-system&#34;&gt;Regarding work within the system.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including myself, out of the 7 students present, 5 of us are effectively working in “governmental, institutional, and enterprise units” within the system. The teacher offered a lot of opinions and suggestions on working within the system, also sharing many of his observations from working in the local system in Foshan. As some of the content is sensitive, it has not been written out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gathering was indeed a rare opportunity. We arrived at 4 pm in the afternoon, and while waiting for the teacher and other classmates to arrive, we played the card game “Guan Dang” (Gentlemen’s Agreement) as we chatted, with one of our classmates working at a central enterprise saying, “It’s like not eating at all if you don’t play ‘Guan Dang’.” During the meal, we listened to the teacher “lecture” almost throughout, and the teacher even specifically commented on the phenomenon of “Guan Dang.” After the teacher left early due to time constraints, we chatted informally until almost 11 pm before dispersing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;there-is-no-template-for-choosing-the-path-of-life&#34;&gt;There is no template for choosing the path of life
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eight classmates who attended the reunion had all graduated from the same class but later embarked on completely different paths in life. If we extend this group to the entire class of over 40 students, their paths become even more diverse and complex. In general, however, we all stood at the same starting point at the same time, seeking different lives. The vast differences that followed may have been more related to each family’s and personal choices. Even among those who pursued the same profession, different classmates took different paths. For example, in our class, four students became ordinary lawyers, one of whom has been practicing law in Foshan for 13 years and has had a smooth career development; another student who did not attend the dinner began practicing law only 10 years after graduation and is still in the early stages; one student who practices law in Shenzhen opened their own law firm early on and has recently opened branches in other places; and another student who practices law in Chengdu pursued a master’s degree after graduation and initially chose to practice in Shenzhen before moving to Chengdu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-advantage-brought-by-information-gaps-is-gradually-decreasing&#34;&gt;The advantage brought by information gaps is gradually decreasing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we graduated, information gaps were still a significant factor contributing to differences in life paths. Back then, in our class of over 40 students, only a few chose to take the civil service exam or participate in campus recruitment by enterprises and institutions, and only a few decided to become lawyers. It was only after entering the workforce that more people gradually realized the importance of their undergraduate degree in law. Including myself, many of us entered judicial and administrative organs through the civil service exam in the following years. It was not until 2017, when short video platforms began to thrive, that the advantages of employment in systems such as government agencies and state-owned enterprises were fully exposed, and this was only gradually recognized by the public. At this point, the difficulty of entering these professions compared to when we graduated from university had become unimaginable. For example, when I applied for a civil service position in the Pearl River Delta, there were only 13 applicants for the same position, with only 8 actually taking the exam. With no preparation at all, I even didn’t complete a complete practice test, and yet I managed to score 110 points (out of a total of 200 for two subjects) to become the first-ranked candidate, and was successfully employed. Every time I think back, I feel extremely lucky, with more luck than actual ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;there-are-no-shortcuts-in-the-marathon-of-life&#34;&gt;There are no shortcuts in the marathon of life
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teacher used his rich personal experiences and insights to illustrate how individuals navigate this era. In the 1980s, when university students were still a “rare species,” the teacher, with his strong character and self-discipline, successfully enrolled in university and pursued a master’s degree. He then went south to Foshan University to pioneer, gradually advancing from lecturer to associate professor and then to professor, and serving as the dean of the college. Along the way, he pursued a doctoral degree and engaged in postdoctoral research at top universities in the industry, providing himself and his family with ample material and spiritual wealth. In the second century of struggle, in this era widely considered highly competitive, I believe that this era still offers opportunities for many to change their destinies. However, success can only be achieved through even greater effort, a more positive attitude, and unwavering perseverance. After all, the negative emotions of this era are already enough, with voices of “lying flat” and “tittytainment” products ubiquitous. Only by adhering to one’s original aspiration can one live up to oneself, one’s family, and this era.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Visit a highschool female classmate</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/visit-a-highschool-classmate/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/visit-a-highschool-classmate/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/visit-a-highschool-classmate/meilin1.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Visit a highschool female classmate" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last night, at the invitation of a high school female classmate, my wife and I visited her company. The main purpose was to taste the cured meat, local eggs, and other delicacies she brought from her hometown. During the meal, we also took the opportunity to tour the company. Although I often visit companies in my work, most of the time it&amp;rsquo;s for serious business activities. Even when there are dining and touring components, they tend to be quite restrained, rarely allowing for a relaxed mindset like this visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a company engaged in the trade of stainless steel products, backed by Hongwang Holding Group Co., Ltd., one of the top 500 Chinese enterprises. It is a typical family-owned business. My classmate is the general manager of one of the trading companies under this enterprise, mainly responsible for domestic sales. In addition, the company&amp;rsquo;s stainless steel products, such as furniture and decorative building materials made of stainless steel materials, are also sold to countries like Japan, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hongwang-holding-group&#34;&gt;Hongwang Holding Group
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had heard of the Hongwang Group&amp;rsquo;s reputation many years ago. It is a successful example of Hunanese people going south to Guangdong for work and entrepreneurship after the reform and opening-up. The founder hails from Shuangfeng County, my hometown. In addition to establishing roots in Guangdong, the company has also given back to its hometown by investing in the construction of a large-scale manufacturing enterprise in the Shuangfeng County Development Zone, solving the local employment issues for many Shuangfeng residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a corporate group specializing in the production of cold-rolled stainless steel, silicon steel, and supporting fine processing products, Hongwang Group ranks 459th among the 2023 China Top 500 Enterprises and 241st among the China Top 500 Manufacturing Enterprises. It enjoys a good reputation in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mellow-group&#34;&gt;Mellow Group
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This company is located on the top floor of the Foshan New City Xinbao Building, occupying two floors of office space. During the company tour, the clean, tidy, and modern atmosphere left a deep impression on me. Especially the small garden built on the rooftop of a high-rise office building, which indeed had a unique charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/visit-a-highschool-classmate/meilin4.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1636&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in our conversation, I learned that although the company appears to lean towards a modern management model in many aspects, it still retains the humanized characteristics of traditional manufacturing enterprises. For example, the company provides free accommodation and meal subsidies for all employees, and the boss has specially purchased dozens of fully furnished apartments for employees to live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;classmate&#34;&gt;Classmate
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This classmate is someone my wife and I both knew from high school, in the same class. Although she was a girl, during our school days, she exuded an extraordinary aura that commanded the scene, with a cheerful and outgoing personality. Her only shortcoming was her slightly weaker academic performance. After graduation, although we all worked in the same city, we only had sporadic contact with her twice. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until this visit to her company that we gained a deeper understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;industry-contrast&#34;&gt;Industry Contrast
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the stainless steel and metal materials industry, most people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t associate it with women. Yet, this female classmate of mine happens to be in such an industry and has even become a well-known figure in the Foshan stainless steel market, which is quite impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;position-contrast&#34;&gt;Position Contrast
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time I met this classmate at a reunion years ago, she was still an ordinary salesperson. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until this visit that I learned she had grown into a general manager managing several companies years ago, which was quite shocking to me. Most of our other classmates from the same class are still in ordinary staff positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gender-contrast&#34;&gt;Gender Contrast
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking back to when we were in the same classroom, this female classmate was just a naive little girl. In just over a decade, she has grown into a powerful elite in the workplace. Balancing family and children while handling the complex affairs of the company and achieving rapid promotion is indeed no easy feat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Common Misconception about Chinese Village Structure That I Held for Thirty Years</title>

        <pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/about-chinese-village-structure-that-i-held-for-thirty-years/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/about-chinese-village-structure-that-i-held-for-thirty-years/images/20240506152638.png" alt="Featured image of post A Common Misconception about Chinese Village Structure That I Held for Thirty Years" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ‘One Village One Surname’ phenomenon is prevalent in the majority of Chinese villages. However, due to my familiarity primarily with the regions of Hunan and Guangdong where I have lived, I mistakenly believed until the age of 35 that only traditional Han border areas such as Guangdong and Fujian retained this pattern of population distribution. It was only during recent discussions with colleagues and other friends from Hunan that I realized I had been laboring under a significant misunderstanding about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;one-village-one-surname-system&#34;&gt;One Village One Surname System 
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rural China, many villages are characterized by the presence of only one surname, a situation closely tied to China’s ancient clan system and traditional cultural practices of communal living by clans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clan System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Agriculture-based ancient Chinese society saw families and clans playing a pivotal role in the social structure. The clan system emphasized the importance of blood ties, with people of the same surname typically believed to share a common ancestor. Consequently, they lived together, jointly upholding familial honor and interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Land System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In feudal times, land was a crucial communal asset of the family. Members of the same surname worked the land together, fostering close economic cooperation. This economic collaboration also led to their residential aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marriage Customs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Traditionally, intermarriage between men and women of the same village was discouraged, leading to the concentration of surnames within villages. Marriages often took place between individuals from different villages, further reinforcing the One Village One Surname phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Stability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Residential proximity of members of the same clan helped form a stable social structure. In ancient times, such structures were beneficial for withstanding external threats and facilitated effective social management and order maintenance within the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural and Religious Activities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 The clan system also involved the worship of common ancestors, with clan members participating in rituals together. These activities deepened the bonds among members and fostered the One Village One Surname residential pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical Migrations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Throughout history, due to war, disasters, and other causes, some clans migrated collectively to new areas. They often established villages there, naming them after their family surname, thereby creating the One Village One Surname layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;causes-of-the-misconception&#34;&gt;Causes of the Misconception
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factor of Birthplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The reason why I held this misconception for 35 years, failing to recognize the common situation in rural China, is mainly related to my birthplace. I was born in a remote mountainous area in central Hunan, where within a few hundred meters of my home, according to the organizational structure of Chinese villages, belonged to the same village group. This village group had about 20 families, totaling around 70 people. However, these 20 families had 8 different surnames, with the most populous surname represented by only a few families. These surnames include Zeng, Peng, Qin, Zhou, He, Xie, Yu, and Wang, among others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Situation in Hometown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If the map is expanded to cover our entire village, about 2 square kilometers (approximately 600 people), the distribution of surnames is even more extensive. Even though I have been away from my hometown for nearly 18 years, I still remember many family surnames in the village. In addition to the 8 surnames mentioned above, there were at least the following surnames in our village: Sun, Hu, Jiang, Song, Ge, Qu, Chen, Xiong, Liao, Liu, Li, Long, Zhu, Su, Lei, Zuo, and Chen, among others. If one were to consult the household registration records, there should actually be more than 30 surnames.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Historical Reasons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
According to my family genealogy, our He ancestors migrated from Taihe County, Jiangxi, to Xiangxiang County, Hunan, in 924 AD, and then spread out in Hunan, forming the largest settlement area of the He surname in all of China. According to the 2021 China Name Report released by the Public Security Ministry’s Household Registration Management Research Center, Hunan has become the province with the largest distribution of the He surname, accounting for about 15.3% of the total He population in China. Since I have lived in Hunan and Guangdong for a long time, it was natural for me to compare the two and assume that the history of surname formation in Hunan, like that of our He surname, spanned over a thousand years, while most village families in Guangdong were formed by immigrants in the mid to late 15th century during the Ming Dynasty. This naturally led to a situation where one area had villages with mixed surnames, while the other had villages with uniform surnames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media Reasons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 In general public opinion and media impression, Guangdong and Fujian are considered to be the places where the “clan power” is most preserved in China. When it comes to the “clan” issue, I immediately think of the “One Village One Surname” phenomenon and believe that the strong clan atmosphere in Guangdong and Fujian is caused by this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-truman-show&#34;&gt;The Truman Show
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show It was only after learning from many friends from Hunan and other provinces that I realized the “One Village One Surname” phenomenon is indeed the reality in most rural areas across China, including in Hunan. This came as a surprise, giving me a sense of “I was the clown all along.” If “One Village One Surname” is the norm, then my hometown seems to be an exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Administrative Division Issue&lt;/strong&gt;: I was born in Shuangfeng County, Hunan, but this county is relatively new, established only in 1953, with a history of just 70 years. For nearly 2,000 years, from 3 BC to 1953, Shuangfeng County was part of Xiangxiang County. I have consulted the “Annals of Shuangfeng County” multiple times but never found any content indicating a special situation regarding surname distribution. It was only when comparing the “Annals of Shuangfeng County” with the sections on surnames in the “Annals of Nanhai County,” “Annals of Zhongshan County,” and “Annals of Panyu County” in Guangdong that I discovered Shuangfeng County indeed has significantly more surnames than these counties in Guangdong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis-of-causes&#34;&gt;Analysis of Causes
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After confirming the uniqueness of surname distribution in my hometown, I was initially skeptical of this conclusion. Shuangfeng is an ordinary county in Hunan, geographically located in the central part of the province, and there is nothing special about it among the more than 100 county-level administrative regions in Hunan. The only thing that struck me as different is that Shuangfeng was the birthplace of the most important historical figure in modern Hunan history: Zeng Guofan. Therefore, in researching this issue, I focused most of my efforts on matters related to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, since Zeng Guofan’s residence is less than two kilometers from my home, I grew up listening to stories about him. When the clues pointed to something related to him, I already guessed the conclusion: the aftermath of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Qing Government’s Local Disbandment Policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After the Opium War broke out, Western powers successively invaded China. To counter imperialism, the Qing government organized a large number of soldiers in Hunan to participate in the war. However, after the Opium War ended, as the conflict subsided, the Qing government adopted a policy of disbanding locally the soldiers recruited from southern provinces, including Hunan, leading to a large number of demobilized soldiers and deserters scattering far from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Taiping Rebellion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In June 1852, the Taiping Army entered Hunan from Guangxi, under the banner of Christianity, calling on the poor and oppressed to join the Taiping forces and share in the peace of the realm. Many people from Hunan joined the Taiping Army. Within less than a year, the Taiping Army entered and left Hunan four times, affecting more than 60 counties. Starting with less than 10,000 troops when they first entered Hunan, they had grown to a 150,000-strong army by the time they left. Most of the Hunanese who joined the Taiping Army, except for those who defected to the Xiang Army, met with a doomed fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After the Taiping Army entered Hunan, it inflicted devastating damage on the clan system in the province&lt;/strong&gt; (from “A Study of Hunan’s Clan System in Modern Times” by Tan Jianguo)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They opposed the worship of ancestors, demanding that people believe in the only true God, the “Heavenly Father,” and recklessly burned and destroyed ancestral halls and the spirit tablets of ancestors. As Zeng Guofan said, wherever the Taiping Army went, “no temple was left unburned, no image untouched.” For instance, after Jiahe County was captured by the Taiping Army, “the city was left in ruins, and the school, examination pavilions, and village ancestral halls, as well as nunneries, were all destroyed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They severely cracked down on and suppressed clan militias that opposed the Taiping Army. Many clans in Hunan organized militias and built fortifications to protect themselves and resist the Taiping Army after it entered the province. Some clans even led their members to encircle and annihilate the Taiping Army. Numerous clan militias suffered heavy casualties in battles with the Taiping Army, severely damaging their vitality, and some were even completely wiped out. For example, the landlord Cao Kuilong led his able-bodied clansmen to annihilate the Taiping Army but was subsequently destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clan members were either abducted, brutally killed, or forced to flee and scatter. Records of such events can be found frequently in local chronicles. For instance, in Jiahe County, “over a hundred members from two clans were abducted, and thousands were abducted in the entire county. Although some have gradually returned, a quarter of them have not.” After Dong’an City fell, the Taiping Army “slaughtered over a thousand men and women in the city.” In Chenzhou, the Taiping Army “occupied the area, massacring mercilessly. Many abducted residents did not return, and entire villages were reduced to ashes, with nearly every household deserted.” As such, the clan system and clan power suffered a severe blow in this tumultuous revolutionary movement, beginning their decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishment of the Xiang Army&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Zeng Guofan was born in Xingle Township, Hetang, Xiangxiang County, Changsha Prefecture, Hunan, which is now part of Shuangfeng County’s Heye Town. In the process of establishing the Xiang Army, he recruited a large number of locals as soldiers. For example, when setting up the Xiang Army’s naval force, Zeng Guofan required that “the sailors must number four thousand, all from Xiangxiang County, without the use of soldiers from other counties.” His brother, Zeng Guoquan, recruited people exclusively from Xiangxiang County, and even more specifically, from the area within ten miles of their home. From 1853 to 1869, nearly 100,000 people from Xiangxiang County joined the Xiang Army, with the number of officers reaching 7,886. Given that the entire population of Xiangxiang County was less than 500,000 at the time, almost every household had members who enlisted, and Heye Town, where my family is from (then part of Xiangxiang County’s Hetang 24th District), had the highest enlistment rate in the county. For instance, four out of Zeng Guofan’s five brothers joined the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the “Xiangxiang County Annals” of the Tongzhi era, from the third year of the Xianfeng reign to the eighth year of the Tongzhi reign (1853–1869), there were a total of 7,886 generals from Xiangxiang County. These generals were divided into two categories: civil officials with military achievements, including governors, lieutenant governors, provincial administrators, provincial inspectors, circuit intendants, prefects, salt commissioners, directors of medical services, associate prefects, prefects, associate magistrates, magistrates, and assistant magistrates, totaling 358 people; and military officials with military achievements, including military governors, commanding generals, lieutenant generals, colonels, brigadiers, regimental commanders, battalion commanders, company commanders, and platoon leaders, totaling 7,528 people. Among them, there were 8 governors and lieutenant governors, 39 provincial administrators, inspectors, and circuit intendants, 283 prefects, magistrates, and assistant magistrates, 183 military governors, 417 commanding generals, and 1,132 lieutenant generals and colonels. The Tongzhi annals also recorded 21,335 volunteer soldiers who died in battle or from illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conquest of Eighteen Provinces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As the most legendary traditional army in modern Chinese history, the Xiang Army played a pivotal role in the development of Chinese history, with half of modern Chinese history having some connection to the Xiang Army, especially for Hunan. The emergence of the Xiang Army brought Hunan, a place that had been obscure for thousands of years, to the forefront, creating countless heroic stories. For example, Mao Zedong’s father joined the Xiang Army founded by Zeng Guofan. &lt;br&gt;
In the second half of the 19th century, the mark of the Xiang Army was left across China, with Xiangxiang County even boasting the achievement of “one county’s soldiers conquering eighteen provinces.” It was during the years of continuous warfare that my hometown began to see a large number of empty-nest families, inevitably leading to increased internal migration to fill the population gap caused by war. Additionally, some soldiers and officers of the Xiang Army who followed Zeng Guofan’s brothers settled here, further complicating the local distribution of surnames.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quelling the Taiping Rebellion&lt;/strong&gt;: In 1852, to resist the Taiping Rebellion, Zeng Guofan began to organize the Xiang Army. Over the course of 12 years until the rebellion was quelled in 1864, the Xiang Army mostly suffered defeats and was known as “frequently defeated in battle, yet repeatedly returning to fight.” Countless Xiang Army soldiers died or were wounded during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quelling the Nian Rebellion&lt;/strong&gt; ：After the failure of the Taiping Rebellion, some of the Xiang Army was disbanded and returned to their hometowns, but a portion continued to serve. For instance, in 1867 (the sixth year of the Tongzhi reign), the Xiang Army suffered a surprise attack by the Nian Army in Qishui County, Hubei, resulting in the death of 5,281 soldiers, including the maternal grandfather of Cai Hesen (one of the founders of the Communist Party of China).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lüqiao Incident&lt;/strong&gt;：In 1874 (the 13th year of the Tongzhi reign), a Ryukyu fishing boat was stranded in Taiwan due to a typhoon and conflicts arose with the local Gaoshan people, resulting in the death of 54 Ryukyu fishermen. Japan used this incident as a pretext to send 3,000 soldiers to invade southern Taiwan in May 1874, starting the Japanese invasion of Taiwan. The Xiang Army was ordered to station in Xiamen, ultimately forcing Japan to withdraw from Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconquest of Xinjiang&lt;/strong&gt;：In 1876 (the second year of the Guangxu reign), Xiang Army generals Zuo Zongtang and Liu Jintang led troops into Xinjiang, successfully reclaiming the region by January 2, 1878 (the third year of the Guangxu reign). With the Xiang Army as a backdrop, Zeng Guofan’s son, Zeng Jize, successfully negotiated the “Ili Treaty” with Tsarist Russia in 1881 (the seventh year of the Guangxu reign), successfully recovering Ili from Russian control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Battle of Tamsui&lt;/strong&gt; ：In October 1884 (the 10th year of the Qing Guangxu reign), during the Sino-French War, the Xiang Army resisted French invasion at Tamsui (now part of New Taipei City), achieving a significant victory for the Qing army in the later stages of the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Victory at Zhennan Pass&lt;/strong&gt;：In November 1883, with the Yuenan-French situation critical, to strengthen the defense of the Guangxi border, Zuo Zongtang recommended the Xiang Army general Wang Debang to be stationed at the border. Wang Debang recruited Xiang Army soldiers in Hunan to assist Feng Zicai in the Battle of Zhennan Pass, where they defeated the French invaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Battle of Niuzhuang&lt;/strong&gt;： In 1894, the First Sino-Japanese War broke out. The Huai Army, led by Li Hongzhang, suffered successive defeats from the Battle of Pyongyang, leading to a catastrophic retreat. After experiencing the campaigns against the Taiping, the Nian, as well as the pacification of Xinjiang, the Xiang Army, once again, was brought to the forefront. In the Battle of Niuzhuang, 1,880 Xiang Army soldiers heroically sacrificed themselves, writing the final chapter of the Xiang Army’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;two-additional-questions-needing-clarification&#34;&gt;Two Additional Questions Needing Clarification
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.How to View the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement is an unavoidable topic in modern Chinese history. Different eras have different views on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, and some of these views are incompatible, almost without any intersection points. If we set aside the issue of “Li Xiucheng,” I believe that most people would still evaluate the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement in a more rational manner. A careful study of Hong Xiuquan and the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement reveals that it was just another failed case of a peasant uprising, with no substantial difference from the Nian Rebellion. The Christian doctrines employed by the movement, including some sporadic expressions of anti-imperialist nature, were just the inevitable backdrop of that era. However, when it comes to evaluating the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, things become much more complex once the issue of “Li Xiucheng” is involved. For a long time after Qiao Benyu published “Evaluation of Li Xiucheng’s Autobiography” in 1962, criticizing Li Xiucheng for being “loyal but not loyal,” the issue of Li Xiucheng became a hot topic in the study of modern Chinese history, and it even became the most studied figure in modern history for a time. The research on Li Xiucheng ultimately boils down to a question of political stance. If one takes a liberal stance, Li Xiucheng did indeed guide the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement towards becoming a capitalist country, enough to be revered as a pioneer by liberals; if one takes a classist stance, Li Xiucheng’s betrayal of the peasant revolution is indeed the greatest stain on his life. Especially after he was captured, his attempt to persuade Zeng Guofan to rebel against the Qing dynasty and declare himself emperor can be seen as evidence that the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement still had not escaped the shackles of the old-style peasant uprising, including the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom itself, which was just another failed feudal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black on white, the evidence is ironclad; Li Xiucheng’s loyalty did not endure, not a lesson to be learned.”  – Mao Zedong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Heavenly Kingdom relied on the rise of a new talent, Li Xiucheng, to support it, but the rest of its political and military efforts could not match his.” – A Comprehensive History of China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li Xiucheng was born into a poor peasant family, grew up fighting hunger and cold, joined the God Worshipping Society, participated in the Jintian Uprising, and his entire family joined the ranks. Through the crucible of revolution, he rose from a soldier to the highest commander of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Army. He lived a life of “iron-hearted loyalty,” leaving heroic deeds that moved people to sing and cry. Unfortunately, his country was destroyed, and he was captured. His attempt to use a false surrender tactic, like Jiang Wei, was detrimental to the spirit of revolutionary education. The history is ruthless, and criticism is inevitable, but it is also a pity! – A History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement is a very dark chapter in Chinese history, and I have always wanted to remain silent about it. Yet, the charm and hardships of the early days of the movement also inspire awe. This movement originated from noble, exaggerated yet distorted ideals, advanced rapidly with strategic movements, threatening the Qing government’s rule. It swept away everything, refusing to rebuild, trying to overthrow the Qing dynasty but unable to rule the country. The Taiping Army committed arson, murder, and looting, causing widespread suffering, and was eventually suppressed by the Qing army and foreign forces. This movement foreshadowed that China needed a true political transformation, to change its closed-door policy, and usher in a new era, becoming a truly civilized and humane nation. – Mou Yat-sen&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.How to View the Xiang Army’s Massacre Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xiang Army’s massacre problem has always been the biggest stain on the Xiang Army. Indeed, according to contemporary ethics, it is. However, in ancient times, war was indeed that bloody, including the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, without exception. It is only because the historical moment of the Xiang Army’s massacre has reached the 1860s, which is relatively close to the contemporary period, that it seems especially out of the ordinary. Moreover, the location was in Nanjing, and 73 years later, the Japanese invaders committed a horrific massacre there, making it easy to compare the two events. Here, I also don’t want to “wash the dirt,” but it needs to be pointed out that some people vilify the Xiang Army on one hand and glorify the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom on the other, which is either stupidity or malice. Regarding the dark history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, I will not quote it here, but I will simply quote the views of scholars on this event, along with a few bloody incidents from the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In examining the issue of massive population loss during the Nanjing-Jiangnan war during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, the indiscriminate killing, and sometimes even severe killing by both the Taiping Army and the Qing Army were undoubtedly the most important reasons. However, as time passed, regimes changed, and various political factors were considered, the indiscriminate killing committed by both armies had different interpretations in different historical periods. For a long time, due to the legitimacy of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement as a peasant uprising, the indiscriminate killing by the Taiping Army during the Jiangnan war was, to some extent, diluted by its supposed revolutionary nature. At the same time, with the recent academic reinterpretation of the entire late Qing Dynasty history, the serious crimes of indiscriminate killing committed by the Qing Army during the Jiangnan war were, to some extent, intentionally or unintentionally diluted, and the indiscriminate killing during the war was more often attributed to the Taiping Army, while giving full affirmation, even exaggeration, to Zeng Guofan and his Xiang Army in suppressing the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. It can be said that regardless of the focus of research and the positions held, deliberately exaggerating or avoiding the indiscriminate killing and crimes against humanity of one side is not an objective attitude of historical research. Only by seriously considering the advantages of the victorious Qing government in terms of discourse power and the attitudes of Jiangnan gentry towards the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and further supplementing new historical materials or even new evidence from archaeological excavations to the study of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, can we better restore the historical truth of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement and this brutal war. — Shao Jian: “Discussion on Indiscriminate Killing During the Jiangnan War of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Tongzhi Shaanxi-Gansu Hui Uprising — Estimated Death Toll of 20 Million:&lt;/strong&gt; The Tongzhi Hui Rebellion began in 1862 and ended in 1873, lasting for more than a decade before being suppressed by the Qing government. According to the data analysis from “The History of the Population of China, Volume 5: Qing Dynasty” by Fudan University, after the disaster, the population of Shaanxi, originally over 13 million, decreased by 4.66 million, with a loss of 45.8% in the Guanzhong area. The population of Gansu, originally about 19.45 million (which included today’s Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia), decreased by 14.55 million. Among them, the Pingliang Prefecture, with an original population of about 2.8 million, suffered a loss of 2.49 million, and the Qingyang Prefecture, with an original population of about 1.41 million, suffered a loss of 1.287 million. Many villages and towns, originally with tens of thousands of people, were almost deserted after the disaster, with no one living within a radius of ten miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Uprising &lt;strong&gt;— Estimated Death Toll of 70 Million:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ：The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom&amp;rsquo;s armed forces expanded into Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, Shanxi, Zhili, Shandong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Guangdong provinces, capturing over 600 cities. This sustained, massive uprising movement, which lasted for more than a decade, directly caused an excessive death toll of at least 54 million in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Hubei provinces. If we also consider the population losses in other battlefields such as Hunan, Guangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, and other provinces, the population loss caused by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom War in China would be at least over 100 million, with an excessive death toll directly caused by the war reaching 70 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Guangdong Tujia-Hakka Clashes&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;strong&gt;Estimated Death Toll of 1 Million:&lt;/strong&gt; The Guangdong Tujia-Hakka (Cantonese and Hakka) Clashes during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi reigns (1854-1867) is a major historical event that has been largely forgotten or ignored. This conflict originated in the western part of Guangdong, specifically in Heishan, and spread to several counties such as Kaiping, Enping, Gaoming, Xinxing, Xinning, and Yangchun, lasting for over a decade. The clashes resulted in the massacre of over a million people.&lt;/p&gt;

The plaintiff in the case is a company management company in Guangdong (Company A), and the defendant is Ms. Ou. The case is a labor contract dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1basic-case-summary&#34;&gt;1.Basic Case Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Ou is a financial employee of Company A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2018, Ms. Ou was employed by Company A as a middle-level economist, but there was no agreement in their labor contract that Ms. Ou was in a management position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On April 9, 2019, Company A sent Ms. Ou a “Notice of Retirement,” informing her that she would reach the legal retirement age on April 10, 2019, and notifying her to handle retirement procedures and complete work handover within the specified period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On April 10, 2019, Ms. Ou turned 50 years old. She believed that during her working period, she had obtained the professional qualifications of a junior accountant and a middle-level economist, and enjoyed the treatment of professional title subsidy, so she should be classified as a female cadre. Therefore, she applied to Company A to choose to retire at 55 years old. After inquiring with relevant departments, Company A believed that she had reached the legal retirement age and sent her another “Notice of Retirement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From April 1, 2019, to July 1, 2022, Ms. Ou repeatedly filed applications through labor arbitration, social security fund management, human resources and social security authorities, etc., to clarify her retirement age, but was rejected multiple times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 11, 2022, the Human Resources and Social Security Authority issued a “Notice of Retirement Age Clarification,” confirming that Ms. Ou is a female employee engaged in a professional and technical position and can retire at the cadre age of 55. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After negotiations between Company A and Ms. Ou, she returned to her position on September 1, 2022. After returning to her position, Ms. Ou applied for labor arbitration with Company A as the respondent, requesting confirmation that the labor relationship between the two parties still existed from May 2019 to August 2022, and requesting the payment of 310,000 yuan in wages from May 2019 to August 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 6, 2022, the Labor Arbitration Commission made a ruling in accordance with the law; Ms. Ou was dissatisfied with the arbitration ruling regarding the payment of wages and appealed to the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2handling-results&#34;&gt;2.Handling Results
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 6, 2022, the Labor Arbitration Commission made a ruling: confirming that the labor relationship between the two parties still existed from May 2019 to August 2022, and reimbursing the wages for that period amounting to 70,000 yuan due to the fact that no labor was provided during that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Ou appealed to the court because she was not satisfied with the determination of the amount of wages to be reimbursed in the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 2, 2023, the court made a judgment: confirming that the labor relationship between the two parties still existed from May 2019 to August 2022, and reimbursing the wages for that period amounting to 70,000 yuan due to the fact that no labor was provided during that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court’s judgment was consistent with the arbitration commission’s ruling: given that Ms. Ou did not provide any labor from May 2019 to August 2022, it was determined that her wages for that period should be calculated based on the minimum wage standard of Foshan City. Company A reduced the amount of wages to be reimbursed by 240,000 yuan.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3case-insights&#34;&gt;3.Case Insights
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, Company A actively and legally responded to the handling of the case. After the dispute arose, Company A sent several letters to relevant departments to determine Ms. Ou’s retirement age but was unable to confirm her retirement age only because it did not receive a clear response; at the same time, given its active and legal response, it provided some factual basis for the arbitration commission and the court to discretionarily order Company A to calculate Ms. Ou’s wages from May 2019 to August 2022 based on the minimum wage standard of Foshan City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the process of handling the issue of workers’ retirement age, in addition to clearly stipulating in the labor contract that the worker’s position belongs to a “management position,” it is also necessary to comprehensively determine whether the worker’s position belongs to a “professional technical position.” In cases similar to Company A in this case, it is advisable to follow procedures to notify workers of retirement, consult with relevant departments, and retain relevant evidence to prove that the employer actively handles related issues during the worker’s status being undetermined, in order to obtain discretionary handling by the court and actively communicate with workers after receiving a response, properly handle the relationship between the employer and the worker, and standardize management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4research-insights&#34;&gt;4.Research insights
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the aging of our population deepens, labor disputes arising from employee retirement are increasing. This case suggests that before handling employee retirement matters, enterprises should communicate and negotiate fully with employees, respect their right to choose their retirement age, ensure that both parties have a clear understanding and consensus on retirement matters, and avoid unilateral decision-making. Additionally, in the daily personnel management process, enterprises can conduct legal risk assessments in advance regarding the issue of employee retirement age, take corresponding legal measures to prevent and resolve legal issues related to retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Legally Terminate an Employment Contract in China</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/how-to-legally-terminate-an-employment-contract-in-china/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/how-to-legally-terminate-an-employment-contract-in-china/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-legally-terminate-an-employment-contract-in-china/images/legal.webp" alt="Featured image of post How to Legally Terminate an Employment Contract in China" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a typical case of legally terminating an employment contract, where the plaintiff is Company A from Foshan City, and the defendant is Mr. Deng. The case revolves around a labor contract dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic facts of the case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2018, Company A (engaged in concrete business) appointed Mr. Deng as the technical director. In 2020, Mr. Deng purchased concrete from Company A for his own housing construction, but the company’s system showed that the parameters of the concrete supplied to Mr. Deng (which were for high-grade concrete) were higher than the standards of the concrete he purchased (Mr. Deng bought low-grade concrete). In November 2021, Mr. Deng fell while descending a staircase at Company A and was injured while on a phone call with a colleague discussing work tasks, fracturing his right foot. In January 2022, Mr. Deng’s injury was recognized as a work-related injury. In April 2022, Mr. Deng printed out his salary records and discussed them with others, violating the confidentiality clause in the Employee Handbook, and Company A gave Mr. Deng a Class B work negligence penalty. In April 2022, an outsider reported Mr. Deng’s abnormal concrete purchase data to Company A, and the company informed Mr. Deng of the report and had several discussions with him, but Mr. Deng failed to provide a reasonable explanation for the data anomaly. In May 2022, a local housing construction authority inspection team conducted a special inspection at Company A and found some serious issues, placing the company under key monitoring. Among these issues, such as incomplete inspection materials, test results not meeting standard requirements, and raw materials lacking calibration records, fell under the responsibility of the technical department led by Mr. Deng. Company A again gave Mr. Deng a Class B work negligence penalty. On May 31, 2022, after notifying the company’s labor union, Company A issued Mr. Deng a “Notice of Termination of Employment Contract,” stating that according to the Employee Handbook, the company could terminate the employment contract immediately if an employee received two Class B penalties within a year. Mr. Deng later filed for labor arbitration, requesting that Company A pay for work injury insurance benefits and compensation for the illegal termination of the employment contract. Company A appealed the arbitration decision to the court.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;359px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disposition of the Case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon review, the court determined that Company A should pay Mr. Deng work injury insurance benefits but was not required to pay compensation for the illegal termination of the employment contract. Mr. Deng, dissatisfied with the ruling, filed an appeal. The higher court rejected the appeal and upheld the original judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation of the case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons from the Case Constructing harmonious labor-capital relations is an important issue that must be addressed for the long-term and stable development of a company. This case is a typical labor dispute case, involving two common issues in labor disputes: one is the issue of work injury compensation, and the other is the issue of economic compensation for the termination of employment relations. The judgment in this case protects the legitimate rights and interests of employees with work injuries, clarifying the legal responsibility of the employer to pay work injury insurance benefits. On the other hand, in cases where a worker seriously violates company rules and regulations, the employer can terminate the employment relationship through legal procedures without paying economic compensation to the worker. It is important to note that when an employer formulates or modifies rules and regulations that directly affect the vital interests of workers, or when dealing with significant matters, it should discuss these with the employee representative congress or all employees and inform the workers of the rules and regulations. If the employer fails to inform the workers of the rules and regulations, these cannot be used as a basis for determining the rights and obligations of both parties. An employer with a trade union organization that unilaterally terminates an employment contract should notify the union of the reasons in advance. If the union is not notified in advance, and the worker requests economic compensation from the employer for illegally terminating the employment contract, the court should support the worker. In this case, the concrete company submitted evidence such as meeting notices, training confirmation records, public notice photos, and WeChat chat records, confirming that the Employee Handbook was agreed upon by the company’s union and acknowledged by the employees, and was publicly announced to all employees. Therefore, the court recognized that the Employee Handbook was binding on Mr. Deng. The concrete company also submitted a letter notifying the union of the termination of the employment contract, so the court confirmed that the procedures for terminating the employment contract by Company A were legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case has guiding, exemplary, and referential significance for promoting enterprises to hire workers in accordance with the law, reducing labor disputes, and maintaining legitimate employment autonomy. It promotes the core socialist values of respecting one’s position and loving one’s profession, gives a negative evaluation to the worker’s violation of professional ethics and damage to the company’s interests, and upholds the employer’s legitimate right to hire and fire, helping to create a first-class business environment and achieving a good judicial outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research Insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In labor dispute cases, illegally terminating employment contracts is a perennial problem for many small and medium-sized enterprises. Some companies, when terminating employment contracts due to employees’ serious violations of company rules and regulations, often end up having to pay compensation for illegal termination because of their own inadequate personnel compliance systems. In this case, the fact that the company involved legally established a trade union and issued the “Employee Handbook” following legal procedures was the fundamental prerequisite for legally terminating the employee’s contract. This has typical exemplary significance for promoting the construction of enterprise personnel compliance systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-prevent-sexual-abuse-of-minors-with-intellectual-disabilities/images/1.webp" alt="Featured image of post How to prevent sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the issue of the prevention of sexual assault of minors has received extensive attention, including the promulgation of a series of laws and regulations such as the Law on the Protection of Minors and the Regulations on the Protection of Minors in Schools, all of which emphasize the need to strengthen the prevention of sexual assault of minors. However, in general, most of the above-mentioned prevention work is concentrated in schools, and there is not much mention of the problem of sexual assault of minors at the social level, especially between families and neighbors, and a large proportion of sexual assault of minors with intellectual disabilities occurs between families and neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-shocking-cases&#34;&gt;1. Shocking cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple search on the Internet is not difficult to find that cases of minors being sexually assaulted at home are not uncommon. Here are a few typical cases as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A case of a 9-year-old girl being sexually assaulted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate incident of a 9-year-old girl in Guangzhou who was sexually assaulted by a neighbor for 3 years and whose parents did not know about it has recently attracted the attention of readers. At present, the suspect of sexually assaulting the girl is being detained on suspicion of child molestation, and the lawyer said that the suspect can be sentenced to more than 10 years in prison. It is reported that the reason why the girl was sexually assaulted by the monster neighbor for a long time was that the monster neighbor was an acquaintance and had intimidated the girl for a long time.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl with intellectual disabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October this year, Xiaowen, a minor girl from Maoming, Guangdong Province, who has intellectual disability problems, became pregnant and was about to undergo abortion surgery. This was her second sexual assault and second pregnancy in eight months. The previous time, in March of this year, when the police were involved in the investigation, but a similar tragedy happened again in a short period of time.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A case of sexual assault of a mother and daughter (13 years old) with intellectual disabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mentally handicapped mother and daughter in Lianghe Town, Linshui County, Guang&amp;rsquo;an City, Sichuan Province, fell prey to many elderly local men and were sexually assaulted many times. This cruel fact was uncovered because the 13-year-old daughter was found to be more than 5 months pregnant, and the local police took blood from adult males in the town for DNA testing, and found that the suspect was actually an 84-year-old man.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 60-year-old man sexually assaulted a mentally handicapped woman from the same village and was sentenced to three years and seven months in prison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang, a 60-year-old man in Bozhou, Anhui Province, knew that Zhang XX in the same village was mentally and intellectually disabled, but still had sexual relations with him, but he did not know that his actions constituted the crime of rape. Recently, the Qiaocheng District People&amp;rsquo;s Court of Bozhou City pronounced a verdict on the case, and the court sentenced the defendant Wang Moumou to three years and seven months in prison for rape in the first instance.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was further discovered that some media outlets had investigated these articles, and in addition to telling outrageous storylines, these articles were even more shocking in terms of the figures quoted in the articles. For example, DT Finance once wrote that among the 134 cases of sexual assault of minors it investigated, 54.2% of children under the age of 14 and 8.2% had intellectual disabilities. Among the perpetrators, there are not only strangers who committed random crimes, Didi drivers, netizens who have just met, but also acquaintances including friends, relatives, neighbors, etc. Among them, the proportion of family members committing crimes reached 15.5%, which is the highest proportion of acquaintances committing crimes. In addition, the proportion of repeated sexual assault in cases committed by family members is as high as 94%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 22 months from January 2018 to October 2019, prosecutors across the country prosecuted 32,500 people for sexual assault against minors, an average of 49 per day.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-lack-of-legislation&#34;&gt;2. Lack of legislation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2020 revision of the Law on the Protection of Minors is the main legal basis for the prevention of sexual assault, and the issue of sexual assault is mentioned 11 times, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minors&amp;rsquo; parents and other guardians must not retain persons who have sexually violated minors to care for minors on their behalf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools and kindergartens shall establish systems for the prevention of sexual assault&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools and kindergartens must not conceal situations of sexual violations against minors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools and kindergartens shall carry out education on the prevention of sexual assault&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools and kindergartens shall employ protective measures for minors who have suffered sexual violations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual assault of minors is prohibited&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Units with close contact with minors should review whether the applicant has a record of sexual assault when recruiting staff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State is to establish a system for inquiring into information on persons convicted of sexual assault&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State organs are to carry out necessary protective measures for minor victims of sexual assault and their families&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judicial organs handling cases of sexual violations of minors are to follow the provisions of special procedures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be seen that in terms of the prevention of sexual abuse of minors, the Law on the Protection of Minors mainly limits the rules to schools. But there are still quite a few loopholes in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerabilities at the household&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the family level, the Law on the Protection of Minors only stipulates that when a minor&amp;rsquo;s parents or other guardians are unable to fully perform their guardianship duties due to reasons such as going out to work, they may not entrust a person with a record of sexual assault to take care of a minor on their behalf. There is no regulation for situations such as parents or guardians sexually assaulting minors, and only the relevant catch-all clauses can be applied by reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerabilities at the societal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for how to prevent minors from being sexually assaulted at the social level, in addition to restricting persons with sexual assault records from engaging in occupations that have close contact with minors, no other work measures have been formulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loopholes in the judicial process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the judicial process, there are also great difficulties in the protection of minors with intellectual disabilities. Because the victim is both a minor and a mentally handicapped child, does not have full capacity for conduct, has limited ability to judge violations, cannot understand the social consequences of such conduct, does not know how to protect the scene and evidence, and cannot effectively testify, it is difficult to collect evidence and solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A girl under the age of 18 in Xikou Town, Xiuning County, Anhui Province, was sexually assaulted by three people in the same village from May last year to January this year, resulting in pregnancy. This online post has attracted the attention of many netizens. The bureau responded that on April 26 this year, the public security department immediately intervened in the investigation after receiving the report, and then took criminal coercive measures against the criminal suspect Wang in accordance with the law, and after the case was transferred to the Xiuning County Procuratorate for trial, the procuratorate made a decision not to approve the arrest in accordance with the law, and the criminal suspect has now been changed to residential surveillance. —— &lt;em&gt;It was revealed that a girl in Anhui was sexually assaulted and pregnant by 3 people, and the procuratorate made a decision not to approve the arrest&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-the-base-number-of-minors-with-intellectual-disabilities-who-have-been-sexually-assaulted&#34;&gt;3. The base number of minors with intellectual disabilities who have been sexually assaulted
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-number-of-people-who-are-difficult-to-count&#34;&gt;The number of people who are difficult to count
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimates from media: 2.8 million&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the population with intellectual disabilities in China has always been a mystery. According to estimates, some self-media say that the proportion of the country&amp;rsquo;s mentally handicapped population is 1%, that is, 14 million, of which 50% are minors, and the number of newborns with intellectual disabilities is about 1.1 million every year. The number of &amp;ldquo;marginal intellectual disabilities&amp;rdquo; who fall between the mentally retarded and the normal (generally with an IQ below 70 as the criterion) is even larger, numbering in the tens of millions.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;em&gt;According to the estimate of 17.95% of the population aged 0-14 in the communiqué of China&amp;rsquo;s Seventh Population Census, minors account for about 20% of the population, the same below.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample survey: 2 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the results of China&amp;rsquo;s first national sample survey of disabled persons in 1987, the current disability rate of intellectual disability is 12.7 per thousand (including intellectual disability in comprehensive disability). According to the Second National Sample Survey of Persons with Disabilities in 2006, there were about 9.88 million people with intellectual disabilities (including intellectual disabilities in comprehensive disabilities), accounting for about 0.75 per cent of the total population and 11.9 per cent of the disabled population.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of registrants: 430,000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the China Disabled Persons&amp;rsquo; Federation (CDPF) launched the construction of a national basic database of persons with disabilities, collecting and managing the basic population information of persons with disabilities in conjunction with the issuance of second-generation certificates for persons with disabilities, and through identity authentication with the Ministry of Public Security&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;National Citizenship Information Service System&amp;rdquo;, it has established the only authoritative national basic information database for persons with disabilities in China. As of June 3, 2013, a total of 37,952,000 persons with disabilities had been collected in the National Basic Database of Persons with Disabilities, of which 2,157,000 were intellectually disabled.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of people served: 170,000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, according to the statistics of the China Disabled Persons&amp;rsquo; Federation, there are 656,000 intellectually disabled people in China in 2022&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Receiving rehabilitation services decreased by 208,000 from 864,000 in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it shows that it is indeed difficult to find out the base number of people with intellectual disabilities in China, and on the other hand, it also confirms that the state and society do not pay enough attention to this group. After all, in the folk, the abbreviation of intellectual disability is &amp;ldquo;intellectual disability&amp;rdquo;, which is a common insulting word. As a family, it is obviously impossible to take the initiative to report that their child is &amp;ldquo;mentally retarded&amp;rdquo;, and often can only be counted through hospital identification or other means. But just like the sensational &amp;ldquo;Xuzhou Iron Chain Girl&amp;rdquo;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;The practice of some families imprisoning people with intellectual disabilities for a long time objectively makes it difficult to keep these data in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In horizontal comparison, the prevalence of intellectual disability among children over the age of 5 is about 1% globally, of which about 0.6% is severe intellectual disability&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;。 The National Survey of Children&amp;rsquo;s Health found that in 2011~2012, the intellectual disability rate of children aged 2~17 was about 1.1%&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;。 Domestic academic research usually uses the 0.75% conclusion of the 2006 sample survey as the benchmark for studying this issue.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;That is, the number of minors with intellectual disabilities in China is about 2 million in proportion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, since the average life expectancy of people with intellectual disabilities is obviously much shorter than that of the general population, the actual proportion of minors in the total of about 10 million people with intellectual disabilities should be much higher, and it is more reasonable to have between 3 million and 4 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-number-of-victims-is-more-difficult-to-count&#34;&gt;The number of victims is more difficult to count
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 90s of the last century, some foreign studies found that the group with intellectual disabilities had the highest proportion of sexual abuse among all vulnerable groups&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, 90 per cent of people with intellectual disabilities have experienced sexual assault, and 82 per cent of them have been sexually assaulted before the age of 18&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, about 49% of whom have been sexually assaulted more than 10 times&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;。 For a long time, China&amp;rsquo;s public security departments have not published data on the incidence rate of criminal cases and the rate of solving cases, so it is difficult to find out the data in this area in China.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang Songbo et al., a scholar from mainland China, conducted a survey of hospitalized patients with mental disorders during the recovery period and found that 29.9% of female patients reported having been sexually assaulted, and 75.9% of them reported experiencing physical violence at the same time as they reported having been sexually assaulted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2004 to November 2007, the Lu County People&amp;rsquo;s Court in Sichuan Province accepted and concluded a total of 45 rape cases, of which 21 (46.7 percent) were victims with intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2005 to October 2007, the Beijing Miyun People&amp;rsquo;s Court concluded a total of 86 rape cases, of which 23 (26.7 percent) were victims of intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2005 to May 2007, the Rugao Municipal People&amp;rsquo;s Court in Jiangsu Province concluded a total of 35 rape cases, of which 14 were victims of intellectual disabilities, accounting for 40 percent. Of these, 4 rape cases were concluded between January and April 2007, and 5 victims were all intellectually disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the influence of traditional culture, women in China have always attached more importance to chastity and honor, and the reporting rate of sexual assault cases is low, and the judicial &amp;ldquo;black number&amp;rdquo; of sexual assault is the highest among all types of crimes. Therefore, in reality, there are a large number of cases of sexual assault of people with intellectual disabilities who are not reported and are dealt with by the judicial authorities. If the standard of 25% in foreign countries is extrapolated, then there should &lt;strong&gt;be no less than 600,000 victims of sexual assault by mentally disabled people in China.&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;em&gt;Review of Research on Sexual Assault of People with Intellectual Disabilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the study found that men with intellectual disabilities are almost equally likely to be sexually assaulted than women, and that men with intellectual disabilities are also at high risk of sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-difficulties-in-preventing-sexual-abuse-of-minors-with-intellectual-disabilities&#34;&gt;4. Difficulties in preventing sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;difficult-to-research&#34;&gt;Difficult to research
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, there is a lack of research on the prevention of sexual assault of minors with intellectual disabilities in China. For example, in terms of sexual assault prevention education, there are few studies on sexual assault prevention education, there are more quantitative studies and less qualitative studies, and most of the research content is research on the current situation and countermeasures of child sexual abuse prevention, but there is little attention paid to how the work is carried out, and how the teaching methods, strategies and effectiveness are.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;The reasons for this mainly include the following aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficult to study&lt;/strong&gt;: The study of minors with intellectual disabilities is inherently challenging, because sexual assault incidents may have a low reporting rate due to various reasons (e.g., victims are unable to communicate effectively, fear of retaliation, etc.), and the relevant population may have great difficulties in communication, understanding and expression skills, which greatly increases the difficulty of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low social attention&lt;/strong&gt;: At present, the whole society still pays little attention to people with intellectual disabilities, resulting in insufficient support and attention for related research. In terms of the scope of personal work, the attention to people with intellectual disabilities is far lower than the attention to special groups such as patients with severe mental disorders and the deaf-mute, after all, the latter cause accidents and accidents are very common and more harmful to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of professionals&lt;/strong&gt;: The study of minors with intellectual disabilities requires expertise in special education, mental health, law, and social work, which may be relatively lacking. In the process of research, I found that there is a big gap between the countermeasures, suggestions or specific measures proposed by many papers in this field and the actual situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strong-concealment&#34;&gt;Strong concealment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, due to social and cultural prejudices, people have generally been in a state of &amp;ldquo;talking about sexual perversion&amp;rdquo;, and they have avoided the issue of sexual assault. As for the sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities, it is itself superimposed with multiple prejudices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marginalized groups&lt;/strong&gt; People with intellectual disabilities are marginalized groups, often not regarded as normal people, and are easily excluded and discriminated against by society. It is difficult for family members to maintain rational choices when dealing with people with intellectual disabilities, and many families are prone to choose inhumane ways to treat people with intellectual disabilities due to economic factors and various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;way forward&lt;/strong&gt; Few families of origin can take care of people with intellectual disabilities for the rest of their lives, and most families will choose to seek another home for people with intellectual disabilities when they become adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For women with intellectual disabilities, traditional Chinese rural families often take advantage of their normal fertility to marry off to groups such as &amp;ldquo;old singles&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;disabled people&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;absolute poor households&amp;rdquo; , so that the original family can get rid of the &amp;ldquo;burden&amp;rdquo;. Families with better family conditions are likely to spend extra money and find them a slightly better partner, as was the case with a cousin of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For men with intellectual disabilities, it is even more miserable, often sent out by their families to do the hardest, most tiring or simple physical work, and suffer the most exploitation. I have two twin cousins who are currently in this state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this context, in order to achieve the purpose of &amp;ldquo;marriage&amp;rdquo;, the original family of the person with intellectual disabilities may still conceal the fact that the minor is sexually assaulted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relatives commit crimes&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the lack of awareness of people with intellectual disabilities and their high dependence on relatives, relatives have more opportunities to have intimate contact with them alone, which objectively increases the possibility of sexual abuse by relatives. And this kind of sexual assault is extremely difficult for the public power and the outside world to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-the-general-idea-of-preventing-sexual-abuse-of-minors&#34;&gt;5. The general idea of preventing sexual abuse of minors
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the provisions of the Law on the Protection of Minors on the prevention of sexual abuse of minors are not satisfactory, many measures and future plans are proposed in other laws and administrative regulations, but no special attention is paid to the issue of sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;legal-aspects&#34;&gt;Legal aspects
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Law on the Promotion of Family Education stipulates that the parents or other guardians of minors shall pay attention to the mental health of minors in light of the physical and mental development characteristics of minors of different ages, educate them on safety knowledge in areas such as sexual assault prevention, help them master safety knowledge and skills, and enhance their awareness and ability to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Civil Code provides protective provisions on the statute of limitations for the right to claim compensation for sexual assault of minors, which shall be calculated from the date on which the victim reaches the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;at-the-level-of-administrative-regulations&#34;&gt;At the level of administrative regulations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main norms of administrative regulations on the prevention of sexual abuse of minors are the Notice on the Development of Chinese Women and the Program for the Development of Chinese Children (2021-2030) issued by the State Council, which lists nearly 20 preventive measures, in addition to the same measures listed in the Law on the Protection of Minors, there are the following plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively control and severely punish illegal and criminal acts of rape, indecency, and humiliation of girls and women with intellectual or mental disabilities, and prevent and severely punish illegal and criminal acts of sexual violations against children in accordance with law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual assault committed by persons with special responsibilities to children is severely punished in accordance with law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish and improve mechanisms for caring for key populations and families, mechanisms for discovering and reporting infringement cases, mechanisms for joint prevention and coordination of multiple departments, and systems for supervising the promotion of infringement cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raise awareness and capacity among children, families, schools, and communities to identify, prevent, prevent, and report sexual abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explore the establishment of a system for disclosing information on persons who have committed crimes against children, and strictly implement a system for the filing of foreign teachers&amp;rsquo; certificates of no criminal record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengthen case filing and case filing supervision, and improve case filing standards and conviction and sentencing standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explore the formulation of special evidentiary standards for cases of sexual violations against children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly punish illegal and criminal conduct that uses the internet to sexually lure or sexually violate children in accordance with law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;departmental-rules-and-local-regulations&#34;&gt;Departmental rules and local regulations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the level of departmental regulations, it is mainly the education, the Communist Youth League, the women&amp;rsquo;s federation and other institutions that make special provisions on the prevention of sexual assault on students. For example, in December 2018, the General Office of the Ministry of Education issued a notice on further strengthening the prevention of sexual assault of students in primary and secondary schools (kindergartens) , proposing five work measures. However, the content of the measures is generally the same as those enumerated in the Law on the Protection of Minors, with the main difference being that the preventive responsibilities of local government bodies and schools are emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of local regulations and local government normative documents, it is mainly a refinement of the Law on the Protection of Minors and other laws and regulations at the national level, most of which are copied from the original text, and no new measures are proposed. For example, the regulations on the protection of minors in Beijing, Shandong and other places, the three-year action implementation plan for improving the quality of care services for left-behind children and children in difficult situations in urban and rural areas in Chongqing, and the construction plan for child-friendly cities in Huzhou (2023-2025).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-special-system-for-the-prevention-of-sexual-abuse-of-minors-with-intellectual-disabilities&#34;&gt;6. Special system for the prevention of sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, for minors with intellectual disabilities who are enrolled in school normally, the state has established a preliminary prevention system in the construction of a sexual assault prevention system. However, for minors with intellectual disabilities who have completed compulsory education (generally 15 years old), some minors with intellectual disabilities who are unable to attend school normally, and there is still a certain gap in how to prevent the sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities at the family and social levels, I personally believe that a special system for preventing the sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities can be established from the following aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproductive intervention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Actively intervenes in family fertility services for people with intellectual disabilities to help them understand the reproductive process and possible consequences, so that families with intellectual disabilities can have equal opportunities and resources so that they can make reproductive decisions that are suitable for them. When necessary, in special circumstances such as where minors with intellectual disabilities are sexually assaulted and pregnant, medical services for the termination of pregnancy shall be actively intervened, to ensure that the reproductive rights of minors with intellectual disabilities are respected, and to avoid unnecessary new social tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Carry out regular assessments for minors with intellectual disabilities, and establish a team of multidisciplinary professionals including doctors, nurses, psychological counselors, social workers, and other multidisciplinary professionals through cooperation with medical institutions, social welfare institutions, educational institutions, and other relevant institutions, to provide comprehensive status assessment services for minors with intellectual disabilities, assess possible problems in home and school supervision, and check whether there are sexual assaults and other violent victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family Follow-up Surveys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Establish a system of face-to-face home visits, with teachers, social workers, and other personnel regularly carrying out home visit services to the families of minors with intellectual disabilities, assessing the growth status of minors with intellectual disabilities in the family, and investigating possible sexual assault and other violent victimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote smart wearable devices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ma Dugong, a self-media person, has been strongly advocating that all minors should wear smart wearable devices to avoid possible accidents. Although this idea is obviously too extreme, if it is only carried out among minors with intellectual disabilities, it may be a very good practice, and the government can provide the equipment free of charge, and continue to monitor the use of the equipment, supporting the special protection of face-to-face interviews, evaluations and other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement special legal rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Give full play to the preventive effects of criminal punishments, establish special detection rules for cases of sexual assault on minors with intellectual disabilities, and avoid emboldening potential criminals due to some unsolvable cases. For example, where minors with intellectual disabilities are unable to verbally express the circumstances of the violation, they may learn from the practices of foreign countries and the Taiwan region and use dolls with anatomical details of the human body to use body language instead, which is to be treated as the victim&amp;rsquo;s statement.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Taiwan began to purchase a large number of domestic violence and sexual assault prevention and treatment centers in the jurisdiction. In order to assist in the investigation of sexual assault crimes against young children and children with intellectual disabilities, and to increase the rate of prosecution and conviction, the relevant departments of Taiwan have developed and produced male and female interrogation dolls of different genders as tools to assist case handlers in questioning specific child victims. Pop-up books, human body charts, and other related tools commonly used in daily life assist in questioning juvenile victims. &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Research on the issue of the acceptance of victims&amp;rsquo; statements in cases of sexual assault against minors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The traffic safety situation in South Korea has changed completely
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization, South Korea&amp;rsquo;s traffic accident death rate per 100,000 people has dropped from 25.6 in 2000 to 8.6 in 2019, rising more than 100 places in the global ranking in 20 years, second only to Qatar, Latvia, the Bahamas and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further inquiries found that according to the data released by the South Korean government in recent years, the number of traffic accident deaths in South Korea has continued to decline for four consecutive years since 2020. In 2022, there were 2,735 deaths, and the mortality rate per 100,000 people has dropped to 5.3. By 2023, it will further drop to 2,551 people, and the traffic accident fatality rate per 100,000 people has dropped to 4.9, making it one of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading countries in traffic safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-traffic-safety-used-to-be-a-major-social-issue-in-south-korea&#34;&gt;2. Traffic safety used to be a major social issue in South Korea
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you search for &amp;ldquo;South Korea&amp;rsquo;s traffic safety&amp;rdquo;, it is not difficult to find that several years ago, South Korea had a high traffic fatality rate, ranking last among OECD countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeju, Nov. 16 (Yonhap) &amp;ndash; Seol Jae-hoon, director of the Traffic Safety Research Headquarters of the Korea Institute of Transportation, attended a seminar on &amp;ldquo;Policy Proposals for Improving Traffic Culture&amp;rdquo; held at the Jeju Provincial Government Building on Nov. 16 and said that the number of traffic accident fatalities per 100,000 people in Malaysia in 2010 was 11.3, the highest among the 29 OECD member countries.&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fosu.cc/article/Korea%E2%80%99s-Experience-in-Governing-Traffic-Accidents#fn2&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinanews.com, July 7 According to Yonhap News Agency, on the 7th, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) revealed that based on 2011, South Korea ranked second among the 31 OECD member countries with 105 traffic accident fatalities, ranking second after Poland (109). The number of traffic fatalities in South Korea is 1.7 times higher than the OECD average of 63.&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fosu.cc/article/Korea%E2%80%99s-Experience-in-Governing-Traffic-Accidents#fn3&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, former South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said in a speech on national radio and the Internet that looking at the statistics related to disasters and disasters around the world, it is difficult to say that South Korea is close to joining the ranks of developed countries. In 2010, for example, more than 10,000 people died each year in work-related injuries, car accidents, and fires, and the economic loss amounted to 32 trillion won. In 2011, more than 340,000 people were injured in traffic accidents. With 15,000 suicides, the highest number of OECD countries, and the rapid growth of suicide rates among the elderly population, South Korea&amp;rsquo;s social security situation in all aspects is extremely serious. Lee Myung-bak pointed out that only when the people can live and work in peace and contentment and have a safe living environment can they be called truly developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-south-koreas-main-practices-for-improving-traffic-safety&#34;&gt;3. South Korea&amp;rsquo;s main practices for improving traffic safety
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the whole, South Korea&amp;rsquo;s management of traffic accidents in recent years has experienced a process of transformation from local regional pilot to national promotion, from key areas of prevention to universal prevention, from temporary movement to legislative system, from extensive policy to fine management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;congressional-resolution---traffic-accidents-are-reduced-to-zero-movement&#34;&gt;Congressional resolution - Traffic accidents are reduced to zero movement
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the National Assembly passed the Resolution on Reducing Road Traffic Accidents to Zero, which aims to radically improve road safety in South Korea. Although this goal may seem exaggerated, it does win broad public support, after all, slogans such as &amp;ldquo;promote zero emissions from vehicles&amp;rdquo; are common in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution mainly includes three aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actively formulate and revise relevant laws and systems such as the Traffic Safety Law&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securing financial resources for traffic safety projects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishment of an organization dedicated to the supervision and management of traffic safety affairs (Traffic Safety Research Institute)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution consists of four basic principles &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fosu.cc/article/Korea%E2%80%99s-Experience-in-Governing-Traffic-Accidents#fn4&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human life and health take precedence over all transportation purposes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppliers and regulators of road transport systems are equally responsible as users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road traffic system minimizes human error and, if it occurs, damage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Road traffic system suppliers, regulators, and citizens work together to achieve safety&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nationwide-call-for-ideas&#34;&gt;Nationwide call for ideas
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the newly established Traffic Safety Research Institute has launched a nationwide open contest to call for ideas to help reduce road traffic accidents with 3 million won a year. Among them, the project that won the grand prize in 2014 was the designation of a low-speed zone in the village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, South Korea began to designate low-speed zones around disability care centers, but due to the lack of awareness of pedestrian protection in South Korea for a long time, in fact, pedestrian safety in South Korea has not been guaranteed. In 2013, South Korea had the lowest pedestrian road traffic fatality rate in the OECD, and the situation was particularly bad for the elderly, with the death rate for pedestrians over 65 years old nearly five times higher than the OECD average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the adoption of the Resolution on Reducing Road Traffic Accidents to Zero, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of the Republic of Korea will coordinate the funding of the traffic safety project, and local funds will no longer be required. As a result, after 2014, villages across South Korea have been competing to join the low-speed highway zone program. The plan consists of two elements, one is to reduce the speed limit in the village area by demarcating low-speed zones, and the other is to install electronic monitoring equipment in each low-speed zone to give priority to pedestrians.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to statistics, in the pilot village area, the total number of car accidents decreased by 37%, the number of fatalities decreased by 29%, and the number of injuries decreased by 43% in the first six months after the installation of low-speed zone facilities. Seeing the success of the pilot program, more districts are seeking to establish village areas to improve pedestrian safety. The following year, 20 sections were added in 8 districts, and by 2018, another 30 sections were installed in 10 districts. Local residents generally welcomed the establishment of village areas, and some local governments decided to install village areas at their own expense. For example, in 2018, the Gapyeong government installed two villages from its own budget at the request of local residents. As of 2018, 64 villages in 23 regions of South Korea have joined the program.&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fosu.cc/article/Korea%E2%80%99s-Experience-in-Governing-Traffic-Accidents#fn5&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-safety-plan-is-published-annually&#34;&gt;The safety plan is published annually
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the adoption of the Resolution on Reducing Road Traffic Accidents to Zero, South Korea has developed a series of plans to improve traffic safety every year. For example, in 2016, 26 measures in five areas were introduced, and 46 safety projects were continuously promoted, with the goal of reducing the traffic fatality rate to 1.6 deaths per 10,000 vehicles by 2017, making the use of seat belts mandatory for all seats on all roads, strengthening penalties for traffic violations, improving traffic safety education, and strengthening the regulation of commercial vehicle safety.&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fosu.cc/article/Korea%E2%80%99s-Experience-in-Governing-Traffic-Accidents#fn6&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish a pedestrian-first transportation culture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving traffic laws: Continue to enforce &lt;strong&gt;the policy of mandatory seat belts for all seats&lt;/strong&gt; and increase penalties for the most frequently reported violations by whistleblowers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prohibition of reckless driving and revision of sanctions (implementation of monitoring facilities in locations with optimal control)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new regulations to control careless driving &lt;strong&gt;are punishable by up to one year in prison or a fine of up to $4,000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Differentiated revisions to the provisions on liability insurance payout ratios for uninsured vehicles and escape accidents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enforce control over illegal, unregistered vehicles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vehicles with properly installed safety devices are rewarded by offering premium discount promotions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhance road safety advertising by promoting collaboration among diverse road safety-related agencies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improve policies that encourage citizen engagement, including &amp;ldquo;Good Driver Miles&amp;rdquo;, experience-oriented &amp;ldquo;Advanced Education Centers&amp;rdquo;, etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implement a security-oriented infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhancement of incident management strategies in regional traffic information centers (CCTV surveillance)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expansion of residential and school areas,&lt;strong&gt;and legislation to establish a speed limit of 30 km/h for &amp;ldquo;community road areas&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote Lane Departure Warning System (LDWS) and Automatic Emergency Braking System (ABES) standards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carry out the &amp;ldquo;pedestrian-oriented environmental development&amp;rdquo; project and &lt;strong&gt;increase the setting of areas for the elderly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up a customized transportation system for the transportation disadvantaged&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itinerant education for senior drivers and &lt;strong&gt;complements training centers for senior drivers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traffic accident prevention programs in rural areas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrange traffic volunteers at school hours to prevent road accidents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helmets and child safety seats are available in limited quantities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhance safety regulations for commercial vehicles and upgrade accident response systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conduct traffic safety assessments of commercial transport companies that cause traffic accidents and fatalities, and reward and incentivize companies that perform well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital recording of dangerous driving behaviors&lt;/strong&gt; to enhance safety-oriented driving behaviors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driver training and providing experiential education&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengthen national transport policies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengthen the working-level meetings of the &amp;ldquo;Traffic Safety Policy Council&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Council for the Promotion of Transport&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengthen the traffic safety capacity building of local government departments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assessment of local traffic culture indicators will improve the attention of local governments to road safety awareness&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;The above bold part is a rare measure in China&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Motorway Safety in Korea&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fosu.cc/article/Korea%E2%80%99s-Experience-in-Governing-Traffic-Accidents#fn7&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea has installed barrier drums and rubber rollers in all high-speed turning areas, while standardizing the color and shape of road signs. The use of different colors to distinguish ground conductors at all highway intersections, two interchanges less than one kilometre apart from each other, overpasses with black dots, and overpasses with parking areas on sharp curves has reduced traffic safety risks to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-most-stringent-revision-of-the-road-safety-law-in-history&#34;&gt;The most stringent revision of the Road Safety Law in history
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In accordance with the requirements of the Resolution on Reducing Road Traffic Accidents to Zero, South Korea has revised the Road Safety Act several times and has continuously upgraded the measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significant reduction in driving speed&lt;br&gt;
 In April 2021, South Korea&amp;rsquo;s revised Road Traffic Act began to implement the &amp;ldquo;Safe Speed 5030 Policy&amp;rdquo;. Accordingly, the &lt;strong&gt;speed limit on urban arterial roads has been lowered to 50 km/h&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;speed limit on roads near homes and schools has been lowered to 30 km/h, and&lt;/strong&gt; the speed limit on intercity highways has remained unchanged. The new law strengthens penalties for speeding, with violators punishing a minimum fine of 30,000 won and demerit points, and in severe cases, they may face a suspended driver&amp;rsquo;s license and criminal penalties.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over below 20km/h ：30,000 won&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 20～40km/h：60,000 won + 15 points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 40～60km/h：90,000 won + 30 points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 60～80km/h：120,000 won + 60 points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 80~100km/h: 300,000 won or less, detention + 80 points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 100km/h: 1,000,000 won or less, detention + 100 points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 100 km/h three times: Imprisonment for up to 1 year or a fine of up to 5 million won + license revocation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are penalty points for each traffic violation, and if the cumulative penalty points for multiple violations exceed 40 points, the driver&amp;rsquo;s license will be suspended (suspended). If you accumulate 121 points or more in 1 year, 201 points or more in 2 years, or 271 points or more in 3 years, your driver&amp;rsquo;s license will be revoked (you cannot use it again).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Korean survey, the new regulations will reduce the incidence of urban traffic accidents by 24.1%, the probability of serious injuries caused by traffic accidents by 21.5%, and the probability of death by 30%, while driving time will only be 2-3 minutes longer. - &lt;em&gt;Embassy of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China in the Republic of Korea: Please note when driving in South Korea: South Korea implements the &amp;ldquo;Safe Speed 5030 Policy&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pedestrian protection significantly enhanced&lt;br&gt;
On July 12, 2022, South Korea&amp;rsquo;s revised Road Traffic Act significantly increased the obligation to protect pedestrians for right-turning vehicles. Put simply, when turning right, the vehicle must confirm whether there is a pedestrian crossing or preparing to cross the road, and the offender will be subject to penalties such as administrative fines or demerit points.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drivers must stop temporarily when a pedestrian hesitates or waves to a driver to cross the street, when a pedestrian waits in front of a crosswalk, when a pedestrian walks or runs quickly towards a crosswalk, or when a pedestrian turns to pay attention to a signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the children&amp;rsquo;s reserve area, regardless of whether there are traffic lights or not, it is mandatory to stop temporarily in front of the pedestrian crossing for observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violating the above regulations will result in penalties for violating the signal light, including a deduction of 10 points and a fine of 60,000 won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a traffic accident with a pedestrian occurs during the period, the offender will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to 5 years and a fine of up to 20 million won in accordance with the gross negligence offense under the Traffic Accident Handling Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Korean police expect the implementation of the new law to significantly reduce pedestrian accidents and establish a more advanced pedestrian-centric road culture. - &lt;em&gt;Legal Daily: South Korea&amp;rsquo;s new version of the Road Traffic Act has greatly strengthened pedestrian protection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-south-koreas-traffic-safety-outlook&#34;&gt;4. South Korea&amp;rsquo;s Traffic Safety Outlook
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, South Korea formulated a new round of comprehensive five-year plan for traffic safety, which calls for a 50% reduction in traffic fatalities by 2027 from 2020 levels. South Korea&amp;rsquo;s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has stated that it will redouble its efforts to prevent traffic-related deaths in order to achieve the UN&amp;rsquo;s recommended goal of preventing at least 50% of traffic deaths and injuries by 2030 as soon as possible. To achieve this goal, the South Korean government plans to advance the country&amp;rsquo;s transportation system upgrade by maximizing the use of information and communication technology, big data, and other cutting-edge technologies. At the same time, South Korea also plans to promote a conditional driver&amp;rsquo;s license system for the elderly, as the country is widely expected to become a super-aging society by 2025.&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fosu.cc/article/Korea%E2%80%99s-Experience-in-Governing-Traffic-Accidents#fn8&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of the Republic of Korea has announced that it will spread the next-generation intelligent transportation C-ITS system by 2027 to achieve the goal of zero traffic accidents. The system includes location-based data collection, location-based traffic information, toll collection system, providing information on road dangerous road sections, road weather information, driving support for road construction sections, danger warning of traffic signal violations at intersections, right turn safe operation support, bus operation management, yellow bus operation guidance, school district speed control, pedestrian collision warning, vehicle collision avoidance support, emergency vehicle approach warning and vehicle emergency warning.&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://fosu.cc/article/Korea%E2%80%99s-Experience-in-Governing-Traffic-Accidents#fn9&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging from the above measures, some of the measures do have reference points for China. For example, the mandatory wearing of seat belts is currently strictly implemented in only a few cities in China. Seat belts are rarely worn in the back of most vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-a-little-personal-impression&#34;&gt;5. A little personal impression
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the whole, South Korea has indeed achieved remarkable results in the management of traffic accidents in recent years, and it is indeed not easy to catch up with the old developed countries from its original backward position in the world. Judging from South Korea&amp;rsquo;s experience, I think there are several aspects that are worth affirming and learning from. But after checking the figures from the National Bureau of Statistics, I feel that I will talk about this matter later when I have time, and it seems that there is no need to write about it now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hunan’s Oldest County: Which is it?</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/hunans-oldest-county-which-is-it/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/hunans-oldest-county-which-is-it/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/hunans-oldest-county-which-is-it/images/IMG_20240423_222634.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Hunan’s Oldest County: Which is it?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I came across an article that claimed Chaling, Leiyang, and Liling as the three oldest counties in Hunan, with Chaling County established in 221 BC, Leiyang County in 202 BC, and Liling County during the Eastern Han Dynasty, which is 1900 years ago. However, I have serious doubts about this conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1chu-state-pioneer-in-establishing-counties-in-china&#34;&gt;1.Chu State: Pioneer in Establishing Counties in China
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although traditional Chinese historians believe that the system of counties in China began with Shang Yang’s reforms in the Qin state in 356 BC, according to archaeological evidence, the current consensus in the historical field is that the system of counties in China originated at least from the Spring and Autumn period (770-476 BC), and many scholars trace this origin back to the Western Zhou period (1046-771 BC). In any case, the Chu State (approximately 1042-223 BC) was the earliest to establish counties, and the Hunan region was developed and incorporated into the Chu State during the Warring States period (476-221 BC) until the Qin conquered the Chu. This raises a question: before 221 BC, was there a county-level region in Hunan that survived, whether it was a county of the Qin Dynasty (221-207 BC) or of the Chu State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2changsha-jun-in-historical-texts&#34;&gt;2.Changsha Jun* in Historical Texts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;* &amp;#34;Jun&amp;#34; 郡 is a type of administrative division in ancient China, belonging directly to the state, with counties at the next level，similar to &amp;#34;prefecture&amp;#34;.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first saw this article, Changsha County immediately came to my mind. This is because, in my memory, the history of Qin Dynasty’s Hunan has almost been overturned since the discovery of the Liye Qin bamboo slips in Western Hunan. For a period of 2000 years, the history of Qin Dynasty’s Hunan was based on records such as “Records of the Grand Historian” and “Book of Han,” which were divided into Changsha Jun and Qianzhong Jun. The historical records used in Chaling County also have this background. However, the conclusion that Chaling County was established in 221 BC, directly drawn from the “Book of the Later Han Dynasty · Counties and States IV” about Changsha Jun, seems hasty, as the “Book of the Later Han Dynasty” does not confirm that Changsha Jun was established in 221 BC either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changsha Jun was established by the Qin. It is located 2,800 li ( ancient Chinese length unit) south of Luoyang. It consists of thirteen cities, with 255,854 households and 1,953,072 people. Including Linxiang, You, Chaling, Ancheng, Ling, Xiangnan, Liandao, Zhaoling, Yiyang, Xiajun, Luo, Liling, Rongling, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;——“Book of the Later Han Dynasty · Counties and States IV”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 26th year of Qin Ying Zheng (221 BC), Chaling County was established, governing the current Chaling and Yanling counties, belonging to Changsha Jun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;——“Annals of Chaling County”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Changsha Jun may be a later conjecture without solid evidence, according to Sima Qian’s “Records of the Grand Historian” (104 BC), in 202 BC, Emperor Liu Bang of the Han Dynasty enfeoffed Wu Rui, a founding general, as the King of Changsha, establishing the Changsha Kingdom, which lasted until 7 AD. This record from the dynastic history should be accurate. Then, the term “Changsha” must have a source. My conjecture is that if Changsha Jun did not exist, then Changsha County might have existed. After all, the Qin Dynasty had only fallen five years before the establishment of the Changsha Kingdom. So, I started searching for evidence with this conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3qin-dynastys-changsha-jun-debunked&#34;&gt;3.Qin Dynasty’s Changsha Jun Debunked
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the record of Changsha Jun in the “Book of the Later Han Dynasty · Counties and States IV” has already been debunked in contemporary times; that is, there was no place called “Changsha Jun” in the Qin Dynasty. At the same time, there are also considerable doubts about the records of Qianzhong Jun, and it is highly likely that there was no place called “Qianzhong Jun” in the Qin Dynasty either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement that the Qin set up Qianzhong and Changsha Juns is clearly wrong. The two prefectures that were actually set up were Dongting and Cangwu, and these two prefectures continued to exist throughout the Qin Dynasty but naturally disappeared during the Anti-Qin and Chu-Han Wars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Changsha Jun did not exist in the Qin Dynasty, this does not mean that the history of Changsha can only be traced back to the Han Dynasty. For example, some scholars have found that as early as the Warring States period, the Chu State had already established Changsha County.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5changsha-county-was-the-capital-of-cangwu-jun&#34;&gt;5.Changsha County was the Capital of Cangwu Jun
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, scholars have concluded through the study of Qin Dynasty bamboo slips such as Liye Qin Jian and other documents that Changsha County was the capital of Cangwu Jun during the Qin Dynasty, debunking the previously misunderstood two thousand years of Changsha Jun, which was actually Cangwu Jun.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liye Qin Jian, Huayuan Qin Du, and Yiyang Tuzishan Han Jian all mention the place name “Changsha,” indicating that the Qin Dynasty continued the Chu State’s establishment of Changsha County, which served as the capital of Cangwu Jun and continued until the early Han Dynasty. The ancient city of Qin Changsha County is located in the present Wuyi Square and surrounding areas in Changsha City, and the city site of Linxiang County in the early Han Dynasty may have been in Beijin City. It is suspected that the capital of the Wu’s Changsha Kingdom may have been moved from Beijin City to the “Linxiang Ancient City,” and after the move, the original Changsha County was renamed Linxiang County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;6the-establishment-time-of-changsha-county&#34;&gt;6.The Establishment Time of Changsha County
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, according to the textual research on the establishment time of Changsha County cited in the article, it can be known that the time when the Chu State established Changsha County was roughly between 329 BC and 296 BC during the reign of King Huai of Chu.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, among the multiple place names examined in the paper, there is also the current Yiyang, which is still in use and belonged to the Chu State’s counties during the Warring States period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: Since both Changsha and Yiyang are located in northern Hunan, and the Chu State developed the Hunan region from north to south, during the Warring States period when the areas of YunMengZe and Dongting Lake were still vast&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, these two places adjacent to Dongting Lake should be the earliest counties established by the Chu State in the Hunan region.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From the counties established by the Chu State in the Spring and Autumn period verified by scholars in the 1980s, it can be seen that the sphere of influence of the Chu State had not reached the Hunan region at that time&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and the same is true for the more than forty counties established by the Chu State in the Spring and Autumn period that have been verified in recent years.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, from the counties established by the Chu State in the Warring States period that have been verified by scholars, no place names that correspond to the current cities and counties in various parts of Hunan have been found either.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflections on Murder Prevention</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/reflections-on-murder-prevention/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/reflections-on-murder-prevention/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/reflections-on-murder-prevention/images/pexels-photo-270220.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Reflections on Murder Prevention" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appalling murder case that recently occurred in Handan City, Hebei Province, reminded me of an incident in our small city last year. Although this event was not widely known, it had a significant impact on the local area and became a landmark event. The story is simple: in a traditional manufacturing company, a male employee killed a female employee due to a relationship dispute and then committed suicide, resulting in the tragic death of both. This incident became the last straw that shattered our city’s image of safety, casting a thick shadow over a city that was once praised as the safest area in the Pearl River Delta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-and-background&#34;&gt;Case and Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why this incident became a significant event does not lie in the terrifying nature of the crime or the special backgrounds of the murderer and the victim. The manufacturing company involved is just an ordinary small local company, and both employees come from ordinary families without any “identity labels” that could be hyped by the media. The crime was committed using a wet towel to suffocate the victim, and the suicide was caused by carbon monoxide poisoning from indoor charcoal burning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;murder-rate&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Murder Rate&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key factor is that, with a population of only 500,000 in our small city, according to international standards for evaluating murder rates, every homicide increases the murder rate per 100,000 people by 0.2%. The target set by our superiors is to keep this data below 0.5%, meaning that our small city can only have a maximum of two murder cases per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;goal-of-being-the-safest&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal of Being the Safest&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2018, Guangdong Province, with a population of 130 million, set an important development goal to become the safest, fairest, and most just region with the best legal environment in all of China. In this pursuit of excellence, the murder rate is one of the most important indicators receiving greater attention. In fact, all provinces in China, except Taiwan, regard safety indicators as a top priority for the government. According to the common understanding of most Chinese people, the higher the level of economic development, the better the security, and the more economically and socially underdeveloped areas are prone to heinous crimes. After all, as the saying goes, “Poor mountains and evil waters breed cunning people.” As China’s top economic province, Guangdong’s goal also aligns with the expectations of most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;political-responsibility&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the murder rate indicator, since it is a very objective indicator that is almost impossible to manipulate, its achievement is extremely difficult and requires a significant cost and sacrifice. To achieve the goals set by the national and provincial governments, various rules have been established to ensure the full implementation of the responsibility for preventing murders. If any province, city, county, or even township exceeds the standard, it will face strong political pressure from its superior government departments. Furthermore, if the number of cases exceeds a certain limit, the area will be blacklisted and required to carry out key rectifications. The main responsible persons of the government will face severe political responsibilities, and the local city will not be allowed to participate in various excellence evaluations and awards. The bonus income of all public employees in the local government will also be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in the case mentioned above, although two people died, only the victim was counted in the murder death toll, while the suicide was recorded in another indicator of suicide rate per 100,000 people. However, compared to murder cases, suicides are slightly less important and have less social harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;global-comparison&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Comparison&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the latest statistics from the World Bank on global murder rates, as of 2020, China’s ranking is relatively high, about 10th in the world. Countries with lower murder rates than China include Bahrain, Singapore, Kuwait, Japan, Oman, Vanuatu, Qatar, Luxembourg, and Italy, with a combined population of only 2.5% of the world’s total. Even Switzerland and Norway, which are considered “paradise”-like livable developed countries, rank behind China. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://data.worldbank.org.cn/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5?end=2020&amp;amp;locations=CN-US-IN-BR-RU-ZA&amp;amp;most_recent_value_desc=false&amp;amp;start=2019&amp;amp;type=points&amp;amp;view=chart&amp;amp;year=2021&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;traditional-chinese-theories-of-murder-prevention&#34;&gt;Traditional Chinese Theories of Murder Prevention
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, the theory of crime prevention has been an important part of Chinese philosophy. Ancient Chinese sages regarded “treating the disease before it occurs, managing chaos before it arises” as the highest realm and the best strategy for governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;feudal-dynasty-era&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feudal Dynasty Era&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During 500 BC, Laozi proposed, “Act before things exist, manage before disorder arises.” Guanzi stated, “In governing a country, it is necessary to enrich the people first. …When the people are wealthy, they will value their homes and villages, respect their superiors, and fear punishment, making them easy to govern. When the people are poor, they will disregard their homes and villages, daring to defy authority and break laws, making them difficult to govern.” Dong Zhongshu of the Han Dynasty suggested, “The people’s pursuit of benefits is like water flowing downhill; without the dam of moral education to contain it, it cannot be stopped. Therefore, when moral education is established and all evildoing is halted, it is because the dam is complete; when moral education is abandoned and evildoing prevails, and punishment cannot prevail, it is because the dam is broken.” Over a period of more than 2000 years under the ruling philosophy of “external leniency and internal law,” strict punishment was often used as a fallback means of governing the country, while Confucianism’s “benevolence, love, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness” served as educational means to prevent crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;modern-prevention-theories&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Prevention Theories&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the emergence of modern Western legal theories, the preventive effect of law has been discussed as a legal and ethical principle associated with the development of productivity and the risk society. Particularly since the rise of the technological revolution, in the late 1960s, Sweden and Germany took the lead in proposing the principle of prevention in the fields of environmental law and policy. By the 1980s and 1990s, the principle of prevention began to be widely accepted in international and domestic environmental law. Since the 21st century, the principle of prevention has been recognized by various legal fields beyond environmental law and has become a powerful and dominant legal principle. It is used as a legitimate reason for various government regulations and legal interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fengqiao-experience&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fengqiao Experience&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1963, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed that the “Fengqiao Experience” from Zhuji City, Zhejiang Province, should be studied and promoted nationwide. The main content of the “Fengqiao Experience” is to “mobilize and rely on the masses, persist in not escalating contradictions, solve problems locally, achieve fewer arrests, and maintain good public order,” along with a series of institutional measures to ensure the desired outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Experiences&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Intorduce&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Fengqiao Experiences”1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;handle minor issues within the village and major issues within the town, resolving contradictions locally without escalating them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Fengqiao Experiences”2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;assist individuals who have completed their sentences.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Fengqiao Experiences”3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;management of migrant workers in a new model.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-contemporary-fengqiao-experience&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The contemporary “Fengqiao Experience”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contemporary “Fengqiao Experience” is rooted in China’s excellent traditional culture, embodying the spirit and wisdom of the Chinese nation. It aligns with the governance concept of “morality as the main, law as the auxiliary, understanding virtue and exercising punishment with caution,” the principle of “preparing for the future and preventing ahead of time,” the judicial concept of “valuing harmony and stopping litigation,” and the cultural gene of “valuing righteousness over profit, with righteousness before profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contemporary “Fengqiao Experience” can be summarized as prevention first, mediation priority, application of law, and local resolution. In terms of the nature of contradictions, it deals with internal contradictions among the people. Regarding the objects of contradictions, it is mainly used to better address the reasonable and legitimate demands of the masses. In terms of working methods, the contemporary “Fengqiao Experience” uses negotiation and mediation as the primary approach, giving full play to the role of law in resolving disputes, and focuses on balancing social interests, regulating social relations, and standardizing social behaviors within the orbit of the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;theory-of-contradictions-among-the-people&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theory of Contradictions Among the People&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 60 years, China’s economy and society have undergone tremendous changes, and the content and manifestation of social contradictions have also changed, with new types of crimes emerging. However, overall, China still adopts strategies based on the theory of “internal contradictions among the people” to promote problem-solving. In the “contradiction theory,” the contradictions between enemies and ourselves are antagonistic, while the contradictions within the people are non-antagonistic. Among the ruled and ruling classes, in addition to the antagonistic aspect, there is also a non-antagonistic aspect. According to this theory, if non-antagonistic contradictions are not resolved in a timely manner, they are likely to become antagonistic. Conversely, antagonistic contradictions may also ease and show a non-antagonistic side. Therefore, in socialist China, if you ask an ordinary person who the ruled class is, most people would first think of criminals serving sentences. The relationship between criminals and the people is already in an enemy-ourselves contradiction. For criminals who have completed their sentences, it is ultimately necessary for them to return to society and the masses, at which point the antagonistic contradictions have already begun to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, compared to the 1960s, the specific content and manifestation of the internal contradictions among the people in contemporary China have also undergone significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population Changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a fundamental change in the proportion of urban and rural populations. In the 1960s, China’s urbanization rate was only 15%, but it has now increased to 66%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The population composition has become complex. In the 1960s, China’s social population was divided into a few types such as workers, peasants, and intellectuals, but it has now been subdivided into 8 major categories and more than 1800 types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a fundamental change in population mobility. In the 1960s, the vast majority of China’s population lived, worked, and lived in the same area, but currently, the number of people separated from their household registration has reached more than 500 million, exceeding the national population size of the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in the Content of Contradictions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, the main contradiction in Chinese society was judged to be the class contradiction, that is, the contradiction between the exploiting class and the exploited class. Overthrowing the exploiting class was considered as important as overthrowing the “three mountains” of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main contradiction in contemporary Chinese society is widely recognized as the contradiction between the people’s growing needs for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development. People’s demands for democracy, rule of law, fairness, justice, security, and the environment have significantly increased, with more attention to new contradictions such as real estate, finance, and public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External Environment Changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world pattern, the trade war and so-called “new cold war” unilaterally initiated by the United States against China have had a direct and significant impact on some industries that are developing in China, affecting employment, income,and investment security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the economic structure, after decades of development, China has now become the world’s second-largest economy, although there is still a significant gap from its historical position as the world’s largest economy for a long time, there has been a fundamental change compared to the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the information structure, the development of the internet has significantly changed the way people communicate or interact, with the vast majority of individuals unlikely to express extreme opinions in real life, but such information is readily available online, exacerbating the formation of contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the governance structure, in the 1960s, China still highly revered the “rule by man” model and regarded it as the sole or primary approach. But now, the concept of the rule of law has taken root in people’s hearts. According to the World Bank’s 2020 Doing Business report, China’s ranking in the overall list has risen to 31st globally, with the rule of law in the business environment ranking relatively higher, and “quality of judicial procedures” topping the global list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;murder-cases-must-be-solved&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Murder cases must be solved.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After China implemented the “Reform and Opening-up” policy in 1978, the society was filled with vitality and numerous development opportunities, leading to an unprecedented phenomenon of free inter-regional movement among the people. This process also provided opportunities for criminals to commit crimes across regions, resulting in frequent occurrences of such cases and causing serious harm to the safety of people’s lives and property. Consequently, a term was coined within the Chinese police circles: “Murder cases must be solved.” Whether in the civil law system or the common law system, criminal law theories agree that an important function of criminal law is to prevent crime through the punishment of offenders. However, they also emphasize the extreme importance of “procedural justice,” considering it more significant than “substantive justice” and firmly advocating for the abolition of the death penalty. As a result, phenomena such as the acquittal of suspects in cases like the O.J. Simpson murder trial, or the Swedish mass murderer Breivik being sentenced to only 21 years in prison after killing 77 people, occur. However, such issues are absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. According to traditional Chinese theory, “killing someone must be compensated with life; it is a natural principle.” For heinous murder cases, even if there are flaws in the judicial process, as long as the facts stand up to scrutiny, judgments must be made based on the facts. It is under this principle that “murder cases must be solved” has become an inevitable pursuit. Therefore, an important aspect of discussions about murder cases on the contemporary Chinese internet is the unsolved cases from the 1980-1990s that remained due to the lack of necessary technical detection methods at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the principle of “murder cases must be solved,” there have been instances of wrongful convictions, but compared to the vast number of cases over the decades, and the countless innocent victims who have lost their lives, these instances are extremely rare. Moreover, most of these wrongful convictions were not executed due to difficulties in making a decisive judgment at the time, and all have since been acquitted. Of course, with the current level of technology in China, it is almost impossible for cases to be declared solved based solely on torture and the confession of suspects, as was the case in the 1980s. The “wrongful convictions” that have come to light in recent years almost all occurred before 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-practices-in-murder-prevention&#34;&gt;Current Practices in Murder Prevention
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the guidance of Xi Jinping’s legal system thought and the overall national security concept, contemporary Chinese political and legal practices have constructed a preventive governance system comprised of multiple sub-systems. The first sub-system aims to prevent crime and maintain social order. As early as 2001, the Central Committee of the CPC and the State Council put forth the policy of “combining crackdowns with prevention, with prevention as the priority” in their “Opinions on Further Strengthening the Comprehensive Management of Social Security.” In recent years, public security agencies have established the concept of “proactive policing” and “preventive policing,” emphasizing proactive investigation, monitoring, and early warning to detect potential criminal activities before they occur. The goal is to prevent incidents before they escalate, thereby minimizing harm and losses to the public. The second sub-system is aimed at preventing disputes and conflicts through diversified resolution methods. The 17th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms in 2015 stressed the improvement of the diversified dispute resolution mechanism: “Persist in source governance and prevention as the main principle, integrate the prevention of disputes throughout the entire process of major decision-making, administrative law enforcement, and judicial litigation.” To address the periods of heightened social disputes, surge in litigation cases, and frequent petition problems, judicial organs have proposed the concepts of origin governance for lawsuits, police action, and petitions, continuously enhancing the capability to prevent and resolve disputes. The third sub-system targets preventing public safety risks in governance. The report of the 20th National Congress of the CPC proposed: “Adhere to safety as the priority and prevention as the main approach, establish a comprehensive safety and emergency response framework, improve the public safety system and promote the transformation of the public safety governance model towards prevention before incidents occur.” In recent years, the public safety governance model has been accelerating its shift from post-incident response to pre-incident prevention, moving from traditional areas like production safety, transportation safety, food and drug safety, and hazardous materials safety to new fields including public health safety, bio-safety, and cyber security.&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;#720cb51f-e04a-4ea1-b2fa-f98f3eba2fb1&#34; &gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, given the relatively low incidence rate of homicides in China, the occurrence of such incidents is highly random and difficult to precisely predict. The entire society is constantly experiencing various disputes and conflicts, but it is challenging to discern which of these will escalate into homicides due to the lack of clear signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;randomness&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Randomness&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking the most typical “crime of passion” as an example, a verbal altercation on the street can rapidly evolve into a violent incident. For this type of spontaneous homicide prevention, institutional designs must be developed from a broader perspective. For example, as early as 2002, China proposed to build a harmonious society. For individuals, “harmony” hopes that everyone can handle affairs with a more peaceful and stable mindset, avoiding extremes. Additionally, systematic poverty alleviation projects carried out by China over the past decades serve as another form of crime prevention for those in absolute poverty who believe that “life will not get worse anyhow.” After all, traditional Chinese culture has always believed that “the granary is full, and one knows the etiquette” and “those with constant property have a constant heart”; with certain economic conditions, people are less likely to resolve disputes using primitive, violent means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;difficulty-in-prevention&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty in Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a recent homicide case in Handan City, Hebei Province, where three middle school students under the age of 14 killed a classmate and buried the body, has drawn great attention from the Chinese public and dominated headlines for a month. &lt;code&gt;According to Chinese criminal law, the general age of criminal responsibility is 16, and for eight types of serious violent crimes, including intentional homicide, it is 14 years old. For minors between the ages of 12 and 14, prosecution can only proceed with approval from the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate; such cases are exceedingly rare.&lt;/code&gt; Preventing juvenile crimes is even more challenging, as the malicious actions of the suspects are beyond everyone’s expectations, and hardly anyone would believe that 12-year-olds could commit such acts. It can be anticipated that, following this incident, government departments across China will intensify efforts to prevent juvenile delinquency, strengthening all-around protection for minors affected by school violence.Current Practices in Homicide Prevention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prevention-over-choice&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention Over Choice&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a Chinese saying that goes, “Better a thousand times careful than once overconfident,” meaning that even for events with a low probability, one should invest a thousandfold effort into prevention. This was fully demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control process from 2020 to 2022. In order to prevent the spread of the virus and avoid loss of life, China was not hesitant to implement the rare measure of “city lockdown,” a strategy unprecedented in recent human history. Even though some local governments adopted excessive epidemic prevention measures to ensure “zero risk” during the subsequent stages of the pandemic, these actions still garnered widespread public support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;main-approaches&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Approaches&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murder prevention is a systematic project without a standard answer or shortcuts. As a popular joke goes, “When faced with multiple answers, children make choices, while adults take them all.” In my work, I have encountered more than ten approaches, which include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focused prevention during key periods: Analyze the times of the year when homicides are more likely to occur and implement targeted deployments. For example, there is a tradition in China to collect debts before the Lunar New Year, a period prone to severe incidents due to debt collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-time analysis and judgment of public security situations: Police use big data models to analyze “police situations, case situations, public sentiment, and social conditions” in their jurisdictions and organize corresponding response measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict mediation and resolution: Implement graded alerts for disputes that could escalate into criminal cases, such as those involving marriages, economic transactions, neighborly relations, and illegal construction demolition, and assign personnel to follow up on each case to reduce conflicts at the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted problem rectification: Concentrate on resolving prominent public security issues in the area that could lead to homicides. For example, from 2018 to 2020, China carried out a three-year special campaign against organized crime, busting 3,644 gangs and 11,675 criminal groups, and arresting 237,000 suspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevention of civil cases turning criminal: Strengthen the coordination of people’s mediation, litigation, and petitioning work to ensure that disputes among the public can be resolved through public channels, preventing private violent rights protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Safe Family” initiative: Use traditional moral teachings to promote harmony within families and prevent domestic disputes from escalating into homicides. Family disputes are one of the leading causes of homicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management of floating population services: mainly focus on strengthening the investigation of individuals with criminal records and potential mobile offenders, dynamically mastering population information to prevent crimes committed by outsiders. In the 1980s, China experienced several serious cases of mobile homicides, which were extremely heinous and still send chills down the spine today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management of unemployed and non-student youth: Provide one-on-one support and management for unemployed and non-student youth to promote their employment and education, preventing them from going astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supervision and management of individuals with mental disorders: Implement a guardianship system for individuals with severe mental disorders according to a classified management system to ensure that “all those who should be treated are treated.” In the past decade, as the number of homicides in China has continued to decline, the issue of mentally ill individuals causing accidents, traditionally neglected, has begun to emerge. Through several years of effort, this issue has been well controlled overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service and management of special groups: mainly strengthen the daily management of individuals involved in organized crime, those released from prison, community corrections individuals, and drug users. For key individuals such as those prone to violent behavior after drinking or threatening revenge, strengthen ideological education, psychological counseling, humanistic care, and crisis intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive social security prevention and control: mainly use technical means to strengthen crime risk prevention, increase police patrols, improve the visibility of police officers and flashing police lights in public places, and deter potential criminal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management of key industries and places: mainly strengthen the management of places like restaurants, night markets, dance halls, chess and card rooms, and small and medium-sized hotels that are prone to group fights and picking quarrels, and strictly control firearms, flammable and explosive materials, and highly toxic substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive management of campus security: includes strengthening patrols around campuses, improving campus security facilities, strengthening the investigation of teacher-student disputes and dangerous articles such as controlled knives, and establishing systems to prevent campus violence and bullying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical case warning education: use various law popularization methods to carry out legal education, increase legal assistance, and guide the public to develop the habit of resolving disputes and safeguarding rights through legal channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social sentiment monitoring and psychological counseling services: provide psychological counseling and crisis intervention in a timely manner for special groups with prominent conflicts, dissatisfaction with life, imbalance of mindset, and abnormal behavior, and improve their ability to withstand frustration and adapt to the environment, preventing individual extreme violent crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These measures, overall, do not have a so-called order of importance; every aspect is crucial, and the neglect of any one thing could lead to indulgence or even result in loss of life. However, for a mature society, there is a need to consider the cost of any action taken, even according to traditional Chinese thinking that “human life is paramount” and that protecting life is above all else. That does not mean, however, that there can be an endless pit of investment; in fact, it is impossible to achieve absolute safety. Sometimes, I feel that given the current level of economic and social development in China, the achievements in safety that have been made are already a miracle in the history of human development. Many countries at the same stage of economic and social development as China currently face numerous internal problems, and the incidence of homicides and various crimes is far higher than in China. Even in developed countries like the United States, the homicide rate is more than ten times higher than in China. It must be said that this so-called “beacon of human civilization” has its own dark humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Maslow’s classic hierarchy of needs theory, there are five levels of human needs, including survival, safety, social interaction, respect, and self-actualization. However, in thousands of years of Chinese philosophy, human needs are only divided into two categories: survival and development. In comparison, I believe that Maslow’s hierarchy of needs principle is too idealistic, as it has a clear flaw in real-world logic. That is, the relationship from the bottom to the top of the pyramid is not strictly progressive; even if one or two layers are removed from the middle of the pyramid, people can still achieve higher-level needs. For example, Einstein developed the theory of relativity during times of war, and even after achieving fame and success, he still had to worry about his safety. The same is true for the U.S. President and the Prime Minister of Japan; upon becoming the President or Prime Minister, they have already reached the pinnacle of self-realization, yet they still have to worry about assassination attempts. Similarly, during the turbulent times in China, many revolutionary predecessors and benevolent people achieved their highest ideals without any guarantee of survival or safety, and their deeds are forever remembered by future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the contemporary Chinese political discourse, survival and development have been upgraded to safety and development. One important factor is that China has historically resolved the issue of absolute poverty that has plagued the nation for thousands of years, and survival itself is a basic component of ensuring safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logical relationship between safety and development is very clear: safety is the prerequisite and necessary condition for development, while development can promote the formation of a higher level of security pattern. The two complement each other, forming a spiral structure that continuously rises. Moreover, this logical relationship applies perfectly to the nation, society, and individuals alike. Therefore, better addressing the concerns for the life and safety of the people has become an inevitable choice for the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I would like to quote a passage on safety from the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will advance the modernization of the national security system and capabilities, resolutely safeguard national security and social stability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must adhere to the principle of ensuring the safety of the people, with political security as the foundation, economic security as the basis, and the security of military, science and technology, culture, and society as the guarantee. We should also rely on promoting international security, coordinate external and internal security, homeland security and public security, traditional and non-traditional security, and our own security and common security. We need to plan for both maintaining and shaping national security, strengthen the grassroots foundation for national security and social stability, improve the mechanisms for participating in global security governance, and build a safer China at a higher level to ensure a new development pattern with a new security structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will improve the national security system. We must uphold the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee over national security work and perfect an efficient and authoritative national security leadership system. We will strengthen the coordination mechanism for national security work, improve the legal, strategic, policy, risk monitoring and early warning systems, and the national emergency management system. We will enhance the security assurance systems in key areas and the important special coordination and command systems. We will also strengthen the construction of security systems in the fields of the economy, major infrastructure, finance, cyberspace, data, biology, resources, nuclear, space, and the oceans. We will establish mechanisms to counter sanctions, interference, and “long-arm jurisdiction.” We will improve the layout of national security forces and build a comprehensive, linked, three-dimensional, and efficient national security protection system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will enhance our ability to maintain national security. We will resolutely safeguard the security of national political power, systems, and ideology. We will strengthen the capacity for security in key areas to ensure the safety of food, energy resources, and critical industrial and supply chains. We will enhance the capacity for overseas security to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and legal persons abroad, and to safeguard maritime rights and interests. We will resolutely defend national sovereignty, security, and development interests. We will improve our ability to prevent and resolve major risks, strictly guard against systemic security risks, and severely crack down on activities by hostile forces to infiltrate, destroy, subvert, and divide. We will comprehensively strengthen national security education, improve the ability of leaders at all levels to coordinate development and security, and enhance the national security awareness and culture of all people to build a strong line of defense for national security among the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will improve the level of public safety governance. We will adhere to the principle of safety first and prevention as the main priority, establish a framework for comprehensive security and emergency response, improve the public safety system, and shift the model of public safety governance towards preventive measures. We will promote special rectification of safety production risks, strengthen safety supervision in key industries and areas, and improve the capacity for disaster prevention, mitigation, relief, and emergency response to major public incidents. We will strengthen the construction of national and regional emergency response capabilities. We will enhance the supervision and control of food and drug safety and establish a sound biosafety supervision, early warning, and prevention system. We will strengthen the protection of personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will improve the social governance system. We will establish a sound system of social governance characterized by joint construction, governance, and sharing, and enhance the effectiveness of social governance. At the grassroots level, we will adhere to and develop the “Fengqiao Experience” for the new era, improve the mechanisms for correctly handling internal contradictions among the people under new circumstances, and strengthen and improve the work of letters and visits from the public. We will facilitate and standardize the channels for expressing demands, coordinating interests, and protecting rights and interests, improve the grassroots governance platform supported by grid management, refined services, and informatization, and establish a sound urban and rural community governance system. We will resolve conflicts and disputes at the grassroots level and in their early stages. We will accelerate the modernization of city-based social governance and improve its capabilities. We will strengthen the overall prevention and control of public order and promote the normalization of efforts to combat and eliminate gangs and violence, and severely punish various crimes strongly felt by the public in accordance with the law. We will strengthen the forces for mass prevention and mass control, foster a social atmosphere where righteousness is rewarded, and build a community of social governance where everyone has a responsibility, everyone fulfills their duties, and everyone shares in the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my long experience using music platforms, Xiami Music was my favorite product and the one I used for the longest time, but it was eliminated in market competition due to poor management after being acquired by the Alibaba Group, which has always made me feel very regretful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I was forced to use QQ Music for a few years, and even later, in order to more conveniently connect my mobile music player to my car, I used Huawei Music and Vivo Music for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the end of last year, I started using NetEase Cloud Music again. Before this, I used NetEase Cloud Music around 2012, mainly because it was free at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year, a friend introduced me to the NetEase Cloud Music official flagship store on Taobao Mall, where I purchased a one-year music VIP service for what I thought was a cheap price at the time, only 20 yuan per year, much lower than the official price. But considering that the membership services of these music platforms are often bundled and sold with other shopping apps, video apps, and various lifestyle apps, the actual value is just like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that while listening to music in the car last night, I found that multiple songs were automatically switched after just playing for more than 20 seconds, which made me realize that my music service membership might have expired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it very strange because it seemed that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been using the membership service of this platform for very long, so after parking, I carefully checked my purchase record and found that I did purchase a one-year membership service on December 4, 2023. However, in the service record, I found that the originally one-year membership service was altered by the official to only four months after the purchase, which officially expired the day before yesterday. This feeling of being deceived is just too terrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my many years of experience using music platforms, it is basically impossible for me to be &amp;ldquo;kidnapped by the platform&amp;rdquo; again. So I downloaded a music app called Kugou Concept Edition on the advice of other friends, and I heard it also offers a free membership every day. But during the use, I found that Kugou Music is still similar to 20 years ago, with a strong local flavor, and the recommended songs are far from my taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I searched for other music apps in the mobile app store and found a product called Soda Music, which is launched by the Douyin platform and deeply integrated with it, with music styles and recommendation algorithms coming from Douyin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I mainly listen to music by random play and only occasionally feel like listening to a specific song, Douyin&amp;rsquo;s short video recommendation model music product is very suitable for my needs. Plus, the design of this app is very simple and practical, unlike QQ Music and NetEase Cloud Music, which have a bunch of bloated features, so I happily started using this music app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, this app also offers a one-day membership for each use, which is equivalent to being free, so why not use it?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Suspected of buying a fake electric fan but had no evidence</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/suspected-of-buying-a-fake-electric-fan-but-had-no-evidence/images/IMG_20240408_075415.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Suspected of buying a fake electric fan but had no evidence" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the weather has been getting warmer recently, I chose an Airmate FA18 electric fan on the JD.com app. The promotional poster claimed that it is a high-quality, silent fan with AI voice function, but the product I received made me suspicious. It looks like a poorly made product. Firstly, the product logo has many signs of use, making it look like it has been used for a long time, which means it could be a second-hand product. In addition, I found many flaws in several parts of the electric fan, which made me question whether it is a fake product. Since I purchased it from the Airmate official flagship store on JD.com, according to my 20 years of online shopping experience, it is almost impossible for such a channel to sell fake products. Moreover, I have shopped online on JD.com nearly a thousand times and have never encountered such a problem. I sent these pictures to customer service, and they quickly arranged a return. Due to this extremely unpleasant shopping experience, I no longer want to continue buying products from this brand and immediately purchased another electric fan produced by Midea Electric.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the reason why I chose to buy an Airmate electric fan in the first place was because of my trust in their historical products. I had purchased two fans from this brand before and had good experiences with both. But after this time, I never want to buy this brand again. Moreover, Midea Electric is actually the largest local enterprise in our city, one of the Fortune Global 500 companies, and its products have always been trusted by consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Difficult to enable the IPV6 feature for home broadband</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/difficult-to-enable-the-ipv6-feature-for-home-broadband/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/difficult-to-enable-the-ipv6-feature-for-home-broadband/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/difficult-to-enable-the-ipv6-feature-for-home-broadband/images/network-cable-ethernet-computer-159304.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Difficult to enable the IPV6 feature for home broadband" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year, China Mobile upgraded the management interface of its optical modem routers to dynamic passwords, making it impossible for users to modify the networking mode using the super passwords circulating on the internet. Yesterday, I called the 10086 customer service hotline, hoping to have China Mobile activate IPV6 for me through their backend. However, the operator said they didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the issue and were not aware of what IPV6 is. The operator replied that they would have a company technician contact me. This morning, a technician from China Mobile called me, saying that enabling IPV6 was part of their business services and advised me to go to a local China Mobile business hall to get it done, or request a technician to come over for maintenance.&lt;br&gt;
I thought it was a simple matter of having a technician come over and use the dynamic super password they possess to log into the optical modem router&amp;rsquo;s backend and switch from IPV4 to IPV6. So, I called China Mobile&amp;rsquo;s 10086 customer service hotline to report a fault and request a technician to come over for repair. However, the outcome was unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/difficult-to-enable-the-ipv6-feature-for-home-broadband/images/pexels-photo-6489044.jpeg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The after-sales technician took one look at my home optical modem router and said that the device was too outdated to support IPV6 gigabit networks. They offered to upgrade it to a 10-gigabit optical modem router for free. I thought, &amp;ldquo;Why not, it&amp;rsquo;s free&amp;rdquo; and agreed to the replacement.&lt;br&gt;
The problem was that the new optical modem router could not register on China Mobile&amp;rsquo;s network. This led to the following events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technician who came over first sought advice from the most technically proficient members of their local team on how to solve the problem. They sent him an offline repair software, but it still didn&amp;rsquo;t work after multiple tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technician then contacted China Mobile&amp;rsquo;s backend support technicians, who advised him to test with another optical modem router to see if it could register. Other devices worked fine, pinpointing the problem to the new 10-gigabit optical modem router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technician contacted the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s technical staff of the optical modem router. They sent him a system upgrade package and extracted the router&amp;rsquo;s system logs. However, after joint analysis by several technicians from the manufacturer, they still couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the cause of the problem. They even tested another identical 10-gigabit optical modem router, which also failed to connect.&lt;br&gt;
After hours of attempts, the problem still couldn&amp;rsquo;t be resolved. In the end, we had to put it aside temporarily, and the manufacturer said they would send technicians to my home for debugging in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the current outcome is not satisfactory, I am still grateful to these technicians. Especially seeing them still working during their lunch break and the fact that the technicians from China Mobile and the optical modem router manufacturer are available 24/7 to assist with any questions, it&amp;rsquo;s really not an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Participating in rural public welfare activities</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/participating-in-rural-public-welfare-activities/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/participating-in-rural-public-welfare-activities/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/participating-in-rural-public-welfare-activities/images/img_20240401_15481418491084328636247.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Participating in rural public welfare activities" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have been participating in a series of rural volunteer public welfare activities for several days. The main tasks are twofold: one is to help solve the problem of rural uncleanliness, and the other is to carry out tree planting activities in rural areas. Here, I would like to focus on the reasons behind the first issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**I. Land Nature Problem&lt;br&gt;
**Due to the nature of land ownership in China, which is only state-owned land and rural collective land, all urban land is state-owned, while most rural land is collectively owned by local villagers. In both urban and rural areas, lakes, mines, rivers, railways, highways, and national roads are also owned by the state. However, during the process of urbanization, the actual demarcation between collective land and state-owned land is not as clear as it seems, especially in the border areas between cities and rural areas. It is almost impossible for ordinary people to accurately identify whether the land they are standing on is state-owned or collective. This has led to a significant social issue, namely, who is responsible for waste disposal. According to land ownership, if it is waste on state-owned land, the government has specific departments responsible for its management. But if it is waste on collective land in rural areas, the responsibility falls on the local villagers. For the government, with tax revenue and financial income, they can well afford the sanitation work within the city. However, for rural collectives, it is impossible to tax the villagers and it is also difficult to ask them to pay for sanitation services, given their generally lower incomes. The rural sanitation work often relies on the staff of the villagers&amp;rsquo; committees, but these personnel are scarce, making it difficult for them to spare time from their regular duties to engage in sanitation work.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**II. Land Dispute Problem&lt;br&gt;
**Due to the rapid development of urbanization in China, cities are inevitably encroaching on rural land, converting collective land ownership into state-owned land. This process is known as &amp;ldquo;land requisition.&amp;rdquo; However, because the process of land requisition itself requires a lengthy administrative procedure, local governments cannot start the process only when the land is about to be used. They usually plan ahead many years in advance and start the requisition plan by purchasing the collective land and storing it. After the government buys the collective land, another crucial step is the approval of the superior government. Typically, the central government will annually set a maximum number for converting collective land into state-owned land, and each province, city, and administrative area must strictly adhere to their respective maximum numbers for changing land ownership within their quotas. If the indicators are exceeded, the relevant officials will be held accountable. In fact, many local officials have been held criminally responsible for this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to a problem: in the eyes of the villagers, the collective land in their own village has been purchased by the government and is no longer considered their own; however, from the government&amp;rsquo;s perspective, although the land has been paid for, in terms of legal ownership, it remains collective land. Once these lands become deserted for more than two years or encounter other legal disputes, there is a high likelihood that they may revert to the villagers. Additionally, the collective land collected by the government, due to its original agricultural use, cannot be utilized with the various machinery and equipment employed in urban sanitation cleaning processes. Moreover, since neither party is willing to take on the responsibility of sanitation cleaning, it is easy for third parties to take advantage of this situation. Some urban residents and small and medium-sized enterprises may take the opportunity to dump garbage on these lands when there is no supervision, or even illegally occupy these lands to construct temporary structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**III. Villagers&amp;rsquo; Initiative Problem&lt;br&gt;
**Collective land is collectively owned by the local villagers. In theory, each villager has the responsibility to maintain the sanitation of the collective land. However, since this responsibility is collective rather than proportional, it is impossible to quantify how much each villager should specifically contribute to the cleaning. If villagers collectively carry out cleaning, it will also lead to the phenomenon of &amp;ldquo;the more capable, the more responsible,&amp;rdquo; causing those who are more actively involved to bear more. Moreover, the current major problem in rural areas is population &amp;ldquo;hollowing out,&amp;rdquo; with most of the working-age population having moved to cities to seek a living, leaving behind mostly the elderly and left-behind children. The village we visited had a registered population of 4,275, but the actual daily resident population was only 2,184, with 52% being over 60 years old. Particularly in some remote areas of the village, many houses built over 40 or 50 years ago have been abandoned by their owners. These uninhabited places have become the &amp;ldquo;paradise&amp;rdquo; for those who dump garbage randomly, and without someone checking, these piles of garbage might remain undiscovered for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**IV. About Tree Planting in Rural Areas&lt;br&gt;
**March 12th is designated as Tree Planting Day in China. Every year at this time, Chinese people engage in various tree planting activities. For example, this year, on Tree Planting Day, the public welfare volunteer service I participated in planted a total of 1,100 trees in a village. Apart from a small part where excavators can be used, most of the planting is still done manually. While tree planting is generally easy, ensuring the survival rate of the saplings is much more challenging. The trees we planted in early March have already started to turn yellow and wither, requiring follow-up replanting. But some of the trees have grown well. For example, the row of yellow goldenrain trees we planted next to the IKEA Home Furnishing Logistics Base has already bloomed after only 20-plus days.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Updating to VIVO Smartphone and Watch</title>

        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/updating-to-vivo-smartphone-and-watch/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/updating-to-vivo-smartphone-and-watch/images/img_20240401_0932495013864575354211093.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Updating to VIVO Smartphone and Watch" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I purchased the Vivo X100 Pro smartphone and also got the Vivo Watch 3 smartwatch. Additionally, because I found my previous mobile plan with China Mobile to be too expensive, I added a mobile SIM card plan from China Broadcasting Network. Here, I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly share my experiences with these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vivo-x100-pro&#34;&gt;VIVO X100 PRO
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vivo X100 Pro claims to be one of the most powerful camera phones among domestic Chinese smartphones. From my recent usage, I feel it lives up to this reputation, and I decisively chose the 1TB storage version when purchasing. The Dimensity 9300 CPU it&amp;rsquo;s equipped with is a significant upgrade from the Dimensity 9000 in the Vivo X80 I used previously, and the memory has also increased from 12GB to 16GB, which means I probably won&amp;rsquo;t need to consider changing phones for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before using the Vivo X80, I had never purchased any Vivo products, nor had I bought anything from its sister brand, OPPO. However, in the past few years, Vivo and OPPO have frequently been among the top five in China&amp;rsquo;s smartphone sales rankings, and sometimes even in the top five globally. During the period when Huawei was unreasonably sanctioned by the U.S. government and couldn&amp;rsquo;t produce 5G phones, I was due for a phone upgrade and bought the Vivo X80, my first 5G phone. I was immediately impressed. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the phone&amp;rsquo;s system features, smooth operation, or camera performance, this phone has brought me great surprises. In my history of using BlackBerry, iPhone, Samsung, and Huawei phones, I believe this product ranks in the top three in my mind, along with the BlackBerry 9780 and iPhone 4s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vivo-watch-3&#34;&gt;VIVO Watch 3
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vivo Watch 3 is the third smartwatch I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased, and if counting other smart bands, it&amp;rsquo;s the fifth wearable smart device I&amp;rsquo;ve owned. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously owned the Apple Watch 3, Huawei Watch Fit 2, Honor Band 4, and Xiaomi Band 7. The Vivo watch is not particularly outstanding among smartwatches and lacks the competitive edge of the brand&amp;rsquo;s smartphones. However, it&amp;rsquo;s more affordable, and most importantly, since I&amp;rsquo;m already using a Vivo phone, using a Huawei or other brand&amp;rsquo;s watch would pose significant compatibility issues. I would have to install a Huawei watch app on my Vivo phone, and this app needs to be set to always run in the background and set to &amp;ldquo;high power consumption&amp;rdquo; mode to ensure it&amp;rsquo;s not automatically cleared by the phone system. In fact, for a long time before buying the Vivo Watch 3, the Huawei smartwatch I wore was never connected to my Vivo phone; the watch&amp;rsquo;s Bluetooth function was always turned off because I never knew when it would suddenly disconnect from the Vivo phone, and some phone notification features couldn&amp;rsquo;t be guaranteed to respond on the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main drawback of the Vivo watch is that it runs on Vivo&amp;rsquo;s self-developed BLUEOS system, which is too simple and only supports a few apps. Fortunately, it can still use WeChat, China&amp;rsquo;s most important social app. However, because there are so few apps, the watch has an exceptionally long battery life. In my daily use, I found that the watch can last for 15 days without charging, almost as long as many long-lasting smart bands, which is much better than the daily charging experience of the Apple Watch 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VIVO Watch 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;china-broadnet-mobile-plan&#34;&gt;China Broadnet Mobile Plan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;China Broadnet is the fourth national mobile operator in China, following China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom. Possibly because it&#39;s a new entrant to the mobile market, China Broadnet offers very attractive mobile plan options. Currently, I chose the 29 yuan per month plan (only 19 yuan per month for the first year), which includes over 150GB of high-speed 5G data and 100 minutes of monthly call time. Compared to my previous China Mobile plan, which was 199 yuan per month for 70GB of data and 500 minutes of calls, plus a free 1000Mbps home fiber broadband, this new plan is a real bargain. After purchasing the China Broadnet SIM card, I downgraded my China Mobile plan to 79 yuan per month, which only includes 10GB of data and 100 minutes of calls, but fortunately, the 1000Mbps home broadband was retained.  
China Broadnet uses mobile communication frequencies in cooperation with operators like China Mobile and China Unicom. So far, whether in urban or remote areas, the overall network signal has been satisfactory. After several months of use, I haven&#39;t encountered any network congestion or loss of phone signal, even in highway tunnels.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>The Chinese Earth Burial I Know</title>

        <pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/the-chinese-earth-burial-i-know/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/the-chinese-earth-burial-i-know/images/12.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Chinese Earth Burial I Know" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funerals have always been an important ritual in human civilization. In terms of traditional Chinese culture, earth burial has been a significant part of Han culture. Besides the Han, there are other burial practices such as cremation, water burial, and sky burial. As China&amp;rsquo;s urbanization movement accelerates, the traditional cultural practice of earth burial has become increasingly rare. Now, in most parts of China, cremation has replaced earth burial. My hometown, Hunan, may be one of the few provinces in China where Han people are the majority and still retain a significant amount of earth burial traditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-naive-understanding&#34;&gt;I. Naive Understanding
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout my childhood, I rarely encountered funerals. The only vivid memory I have was in early 1995 when one of my grandfather&amp;rsquo;s younger brothers returned to our hometown in Hunan from Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, where he had lived and worked for several decades. He was already over 60 years old at that time. Shortly after returning, he passed away due to an illness, and the funeral was held at our house. This was the first funeral I had ever experienced, leaving an indelible impression on my childhood. Several scenes often appear in my dreams to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funeral procession&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scene One: It was the first time I saw adults crying so heart-wrenchingly. After my great-uncle passed away, his daughter couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop wailing at the funeral, muttering incoherently about regret, sorrow, and exhaustion. Several relatives and friends couldn&amp;rsquo;t console her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scene Two: It was my first time seeing a Buddhist monk in person, a profession I had only seen on television before. However, due to our earth burial customs, we needed to invite monks to perform rituals according to Buddhist traditions for the deceased. They chanted Buddhist scriptures for several days for my departed great-uncle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scene Three: When it was time to bury my great-uncle, I realized for the first time how arduous the process was. The coffin containing the body weighed at least 600 kilograms. To lift it, we needed a massive wooden frame and round poles, adding up to over 750 kilograms in total. It took 16 strong adults to carry it, and each person lifting the coffin needed a backup to alternate, otherwise, it would be difficult for one person to carry it for such a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scene Four: Since my hometown is located in the central mountains of Hunan, it was nearly two kilometers from our house to the burial site, and the mountain paths were usually narrow. Therefore, at the front of such a large group, a strong man had to carry a machete to clear the way. If any trees or shrubs along the road might block the procession, they had to be cut down immediately. Even so, there was still an accident on the way to the burial site. Due to the uneven primitive mountain path, the coffin tilted sideways while being carried. In the end, someone had to jump on top of the coffin to sway it back into balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-full-experience&#34;&gt;II. Full Experience
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time after 1995, I rarely attended any funerals until 15 years later. From 2010 to 2024, I experienced five funerals from start to finish, which were for my father, father-in-law, grandfather, grandmother, and maternal grandmother, all of whom were buried in the earth burial tradition. Additionally, I attended over ten funerals for other relatives. The shortest funeral was for my father-in-law, which took only four days from the time of death to the burial. The longest was for my grandmother, which spanned thirteen days. Despite the significant difference in time, the processes were largely similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacrificial rituals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Placing in the Coffin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a crucial step that usually takes several hours to a day from the time of death to the placement in the coffin. In rural Hunan, households with elderly members often have a coffin ready, typically made from solid wood and polished with a large amount of tung oil before being painted to ensure tight sealing. Such a coffin usually weighs over 250 kilograms.&lt;br&gt;
Before the deceased is placed in the coffin, it is customary to wait until all family members have arrived, which sometimes requires a longer wait if the children of the deceased are not present. For instance, my father-in-law passed away in a hospital in Guangdong, and at that time, apart from my wife, his other daughters were not in Guangdong. So, I drove my own car and transported his body overnight from Guangdong back to our hometown in Hunan, which was over 650 kilometers away, by which time my wife&amp;rsquo;s sisters had already been waiting at their father&amp;rsquo;s house.&lt;br&gt;
When the deceased is to be placed in the coffin, the family hires a local embalmer to help with makeup and dressing. Then, an elderly person knowledgeable in the theories of Yin and Yang and the Eight Trigrams selects an appropriate time to place the body into the coffin. The coffin is typically filled with a large amount of quicklime for preservation. After the coffin lid is closed, it is sealed with wood glue, and long iron nails are hammered in to prevent any movement. During the summer when temperatures are high, it is usually necessary to rent a large refrigerator to cover the coffin and prevent the body from oxidizing too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeking Guidance from the Deities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In rural Hunan, every village has a Earth God Temple. On the evening of the day the deceased is placed in the coffin, the family usually takes the portrait of the deceased to the Earth God Temple for a sacrifice led by a monk or a Taoist priest. This is done to inform the Earth God that someone in their jurisdiction has passed away, providing personal information such as the name and date of birth of the deceased. It also serves to guide the soul of the deceased, with continuous sounds of gongs, firecrackers, and the burning of spirit money to show the deceased the way home.&lt;br&gt;
The Water God is one of the most important deities in Han culture. After the death, the family, led by a monk or Taoist priest, goes to the river near the home to sacrifice to the Water God, which is similar in form to the sacrifice to the Earth God. Additionally, personal items such as clothes, shoes, and socks worn by the deceased are usually taken to the water&amp;rsquo;s edge to be burned as part of the sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Light and Incense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From the time the deceased is placed in the coffin until the burial, a continuous light (changmingdeng) is lit beneath the coffin and before the portrait of the deceased. The light must never be extinguished, no matter how long it takes, and the same applies to the incense before the portrait, symbolizing the unbroken tradition in Chinese culture. Previously, we generally used rapeseed oil to light the lamps, but now special candles are available for purchase. The most challenging part is the incense, as traditional incense sticks usually burn for only about 30 minutes before needing to be replaced. Ensuring that incense is burning continuously for 24 hours is a very demanding task and usually requires several people to take turns watching over it. Nowadays, we can buy incense sticks over a meter long that can burn for seven to eight hours, greatly reducing the labor intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Chanting Scriptures for the Deceased&lt;br&gt;
**After the death, it is customary to spend three to seven days inviting monks and Taoist priests to the home to chant scriptures for the deceased, including well-known Buddhist texts like the &amp;ldquo;Vajra Sutra&amp;rdquo; and Taoist texts like the &amp;ldquo;Rebirth Incantation.&amp;rdquo; The children of the deceased are expected to accompany the chanting throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ritual for Guiding the Deceased&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
During the process of guiding the deceased, there is an important ritual called crossing the &amp;ldquo;Bridge of Helplessness.&amp;rdquo; The Bridge of Helplessness is a necessary passage in Chinese folklore for reincarnation. This process involves sacrificing to many deities of the underworld, with family members usually following the monk and Taoist priest outdoors while barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual Sacrificial for the Deceased&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Throughout the funeral process, various relatives of the deceased offer a large amount of paper spirit money, mountains of gold and silver, clothes, houses, and other sacrificial items to the deceased. At my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s funeral last month, we burned nearly 500 kilograms of spirit money and various sacrificial items. Traditionally, we believe that the best spirit money is made from bamboo paper, which is produced from bamboo that has been growing for no more than a year, and is stamped with copper coin patterns. However, spirit money that is printed in colorful designs resembling contemporary currencies is considered worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family Sacrifice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Family sacrifice is a very important step in the funeral process, usually conducted on the evening before the deceased is buried. The participants are all the relatives of the deceased. For example, nearly a hundred people participated in the family sacrifice at my grandfather&amp;rsquo;s funeral. This includes children, daughters-in-law, sons-in-law, nieces, nephews, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and other extended family members. Each category of relatives arranges a separate sacrificial activity, typically led by one person who reads the eulogy they have co-written, followed by a series of sacrificial rituals. This family sacrifice activity can sometimes take up to six or seven hours to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selection of Burial Site and Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In rural Hunan, it is common for the deceased to be buried in the family ancestral graveyard or on the family&amp;rsquo;s own mountainous land. However, the specific location and orientation are usually determined only after a local expert has assessed the feng shui (geomancy). The timing of the burial is also very auspicious, generally chosen according to the traditional Chinese calendar, in alignment with the deceased&amp;rsquo;s and the family members&amp;rsquo; birth dates based on the theories of Yin and Yang and the Eight Trigrams. Sometimes, if the timing is not convenient, I have even seen cases where the burial had to be delayed for over 30 days.&lt;br&gt;
Since the burials are all conducted on the mountains, the graves are still dug manually. In our hometown, the graves are usually excavated to a depth of 2.5 meters, with dimensions of 2.2 meters in length and 1 meter in width. For those who have never dug such a pit, it may take three people digging continuously for three days to complete it. However, there are also some professionals who can finish the job in just one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funeral Procession&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The funeral procession is similar to what I described in the first part. Currently, we still use the method of 16 people carrying the coffin. Along the way, spirit money is scattered, and firecrackers are set off. The descendants of the deceased, dressed in mourning attire, accompany the body to the burial site on the mountain. In addition to this, there are other procession members, including monks, Taoist priests, bands that have been hired to perform, dragon and lion dance troupes, as well as friends, relatives, and local villagers. This is known as a grand funeral in Chinese traditional culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Announcing the Death and Begging for Rice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This practice is now rare, but I personally experienced it once over a decade ago. At that time, communication was not very convenient, so it was customary for the children of the deceased to personally visit the homes of friends and relatives to announce the death by kneeling and kowtowing. Nowadays, this is mostly replaced by communication tools such as mobile phones or WeChat. The practice of begging for rice from a hundred households still occurs occasionally. It mainly refers to a situation where the time of death, according to the theories of Yin and Yang and the Eight Trigrams, is considered very unfavorable. In order to avoid negative occurrences, the deceased’s family goes to nearby households to beg for a small amount of rice from each, which is then cooked together into a pot of rice and consumed by the family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii-my-personal-thoughts&#34;&gt;III. My Personal Thoughts
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funerals are solemn and serious events in any culture around the world, and this is especially true in China, with its 5000-year-old civilization. From the grandiose funerals of ancient emperors and modern national leaders to the modest ones held by every household for their departed loved ones, they are all treated with the same gravity. In traditional Chinese culture, weddings and funerals are considered the two most significant events in one&amp;rsquo;s life. Even though funerals are considered &amp;ldquo;sad events,&amp;rdquo; many still refer to them as &amp;ldquo;joyous occasions&amp;rdquo; alongside weddings, referring to them as &amp;ldquo;red and white joyous occasions.&amp;rdquo; The &amp;ldquo;red&amp;rdquo; refers to weddings, and the &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; to funerals, both considered joyous events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, with the comprehensive advancement of Chinese modernization, the daily lives of most people have undergone drastic changes. In the fast-paced modern lifestyle, traditional funerals are often seen as outdated and superstitious. Some believe that funerals are entirely unnecessary, arguing that once a person dies, they know nothing more, and thus the practice of holding a funeral is futile. In urban high-rise apartments, for instance, when a family member passes away, they are immediately taken to the crematorium, the ashes placed in an urn, and then buried in a cemetery, all within just a couple of hours. Such a practice is considered unlucky if extended for even a second longer, and the idea of earth burial is even more opposed. As someone born and raised in a traditional Chinese rural area and who has worked and lived in cities, I also have a very contradictory mindset. Here, I will try to analyze the pros and cons and express my personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A. Disadvantages of Traditional Earth Burial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-consuming and Labor-intensive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As mentioned earlier, traditional earth burials can take anywhere from four to twenty days, which is too long for modern society. Even in government or state-owned enterprises, employees can only take up to five days of leave for their immediate family members. If the funeral lasts longer, it will undoubtedly affect their work and income stability. In some private enterprises, taking leave for a funeral can result in the deduction of wages, and the randomness of the time of death can even lead to job loss.The earth burial ceremony is an extremely physically demanding activity, especially for the direct descendants of the deceased, such as sons and grandsons. The numerous kneeling and bowing rituals are particularly unpleasant, and sometimes, when accompanying monks in chanting scriptures, one has to kneel for several hours. For some older individuals, this can be quite a burden. It is not uncommon to hear about instances in rural areas where family members, due to the prolonged funeral rituals, have suffered sudden illnesses as a result of consecutive nights of intense efforts to cope with the ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expensive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In my hometown, the average cost of a funeral is over 80,000 yuan, which is high considering the generally low income in mountainous regions. In 2019, my wife&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s funeral cost nearly 150,000 yuan, which is the average cost in her hometown. According to local government statistics, the per capita annual net income in our county was only 20,700 yuan in 2022, meaning that a funeral can consume a family&amp;rsquo;s income for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disturbing the peace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In rural Hunan, two things are indispensable for a funeral: firecrackers and loud speakers or loudspeakers. The average funeral involves over 1,000 kilograms of firecrackers, with explosions every few minutes. Even on the funeral procession route, large fireworks are set off every few meters, causing significant noise pollution. Loud speakers or loudspeakers play dirges throughout the day, which also affects nearby residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some practices have a negative impact.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is not uncommon to see some funerals incorporating inappropriate activities, such as striptease or love song performances, which are considered lowbrow or inappropriate and generally cause psychological resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obvious urban-rural differences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the process of urbanization, ordinary people in cities do not have their own land, and commercial cemeteries are only large enough for urns, making earth burial impossible. Additionally, the residential properties in cities are generally commercial, leaving no space for large-scale funeral arrangements as in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B. Advantages of Traditional Earth Burial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Final Review of the Deceased&amp;rsquo;s Life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Traditional funerals provide a systematic and comprehensive review and evaluation of the deceased&amp;rsquo;s life or the relationship with the deceased from different perspectives of the participants. This is solidified through eulogies and collective sacrificial rituals, which is known as &amp;ldquo;final judgment.&amp;rdquo; More than 2,000 years ago, Confucius said, &amp;ldquo;A person&amp;rsquo;s words are kind when they are about to die.&amp;rdquo; In Chinese culture, each person in the latter half of their life thinks about being as positive as possible and attaches great importance to their reputation after death, which is commonly referred to as the historical evaluation. Even if this history is limited to a small circle of friends and relatives, it is of great importance to the deceased&amp;rsquo;s family and descendants. A traditional funeral allows everyone to reflect on the deceased&amp;rsquo;s life, which is undoubtedly an invisible moral constraint for each living person, as death is inevitable for everyone. Of course, regardless of the deceased&amp;rsquo;s life, people will respect them and give them a final, objective, and positive evaluation, creating a harmonious and positive atmosphere and eliminating hatred and negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Physical and Mental Baptism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I believe there is no other moment that can compare to a traditional funeral in making people reflect on the meaning of life and existence. Faced with one ritual after another, it is difficult not to deeply contemplate the true meaning of life. Reflecting on the experiences of kinship, love, and friendship with the deceased, one can consider if they have done anything wrong or right. It is also an opportunity to think about what needs to be improved or enhanced in the future. For instance, during my father&amp;rsquo;s funeral, I contemplated how to handle relationships with my children, even though I was not married at that time. Similarly, the names of my son and daughter were thought of during my grandfather&amp;rsquo;s funeral, even though they were not born yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Closer Family Ties.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced society, it is difficult to maintain close contact with relatives with blood ties, and gatherings like traditional funerals that last more than five days are unlikely to happen again in the future. For instance, relationships with cousins and other elders. As we share 1/2 of our genes with our cousins and siblings, these connections are significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obtaining Spiritual Comfort.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are many instances where children have not treated their parents well during their lifetime, especially in families with strained mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationships. In Chinese culture, filial piety is paramount, and if children are not filial, they not only face criticism from others but also suffer from inner turmoil. However, it is not always easy to improve these relationships, as many people say, &amp;ldquo;Why do such complex funerals? If you treat them well while they are alive, that&amp;rsquo;s enough.&amp;rdquo; In fact, because filial piety is difficult to fulfill, many families cannot express their gratitude to their elders when they are alive. Therefore, they rely on a grand funeral to seek spiritual comfort. Although it may seem like hindsight, it is a common sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debts Cleared with Death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Chinese culture, it is believed that once a person is buried, their soul finds peace, regardless of the conflicts or hatred they had with others in life. Even if there is a tradition of &amp;ldquo;debts passed on to the children,&amp;rdquo; it is now limited to the inheritance of assets. Any debts beyond the inheritance are considered cleared. In traditional culture, this settlement often takes place during the funeral, often symbolized by a bow before the deceased&amp;rsquo;s portrait in front of everyone. After the deceased is buried, these matters are no longer mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scene of the funeral&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I believe that providing a decent funeral for the deceased is necessary, whether it is earth burial or cremation, traditional or modern. However, there are also a few suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The length of the funeral should not be too short or too long.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If it is only a short memorial service lasting a few minutes or tens of minutes, it might as well not be held, as it would not achieve any effect. However, in modern urban funeral homes, there is often a queue for memorial services, which objectively does not allow for a very long duration. Additionally, even traditional funerals should not be too long. The practice of extending for more than ten days is indeed divorced from reality and unnecessary. In fact, during my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s recent funeral, I once argued with professionals that it would be best to complete it within seven days. However, due to other special reasons, I eventually had to comply with their opinion and it lasted 13 days. I believe that in urban areas, if the main procedures of the funeral can be extended to one or one and a half days, it would be more appropriate. By adding some necessary ritual elements, we can create a more profound historical and cultural atmosphere, which is very meaningful for life and death education. Traditional rural funerals should be controlled to three to four days at most. If they are too long, there is no real significance. In fact, I have attended several funerals and there have always been some long &amp;ldquo;vacuum periods&amp;rdquo; that could easily be compressed to complete the funeral within the scheduled time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some unnecessary earth burial customs can be combined or simplified.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is not to say that all traditional earth burial customs in rural areas are feudal superstitions, but there are indeed many meaningless rituals that can be simplified or combined. Some kneeling and bowing customs can be appropriately retained, but there is no need to kneel and kowtow to everyone. Some mythical and religious customs do not need to be carried out in every detail, and some practices that disturb the peace can be simplified or canceled. However, we should not be like the government of Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, which recently issued a document banning the burning of spirit money and sacrificial items across the city, citing the need to eliminate feudal superstition. This move has been widely criticized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show more tolerance and understanding for traditional customs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After the founding of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China in 1949, a massive campaign against feudal superstition was launched nationwide. In an era when over 90% of the population was illiterate, with feudal superstition ubiquitous and the general populace being generally ignorant, such a movement was indeed necessary. However, after decades of reform and opening up, it is now difficult for people to truly believe in feudal superstition. Instead, there is a greater emphasis on the inheritance of some traditional customs and culture, which is adapted to showcase contemporary people&amp;rsquo;s thoughts and demeanor. It is unnecessary to completely eliminate them. I sincerely hope that the earth burial customs in Hunan can continue to be practiced in rural areas. Looking around, this custom has almost disappeared in all traditional Han areas across China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Taking advantage of the long holiday, I didn&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to bring the children back to my hometown in Hunan to celebrate the New Year. Even though the traffic jams on the way back and forth exceeded ten hours, such minor difficulties seemed insignificant compared to the joy of family reunion and the warmth of kinship.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/attended-two-rural-weddings/images/IMG_20240331_225552.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Attended two rural weddings" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I rushed back from Guangdong to Hunan to attend two weddings. One was my cousin&amp;rsquo;s wedding, and the other was the wedding of a high school classmate whom my wife and I both know. These two weddings have been long awaited and are considered well-deserved. Among them, my cousin&amp;rsquo;s wedding began to be planned at the beginning of 2023. His wife comes from a remote mountainous area in Yunnan and belongs to the Lahu ethnic group. Another classmate&amp;rsquo;s wedding was planned three years ago but was unable to be held due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has always been difficult to gather a large number of people. Therefore, it was only held this year during the Spring Festival when everyone had spare time to make up for the wedding. In fact, their son is already three years old.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Typical Case of Shareholders’ Joint and Several Liability for Company Debts</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/shareholders-joint-and-several-liability-for-company-debts/images/debts.webp" alt="Featured image of post Typical Case of Shareholders’ Joint and Several Liability for Company Debts" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a typical case where shareholders are held jointly and severally liable for a company’s debts after the revision of the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China. The plaintiff is a certain new materials group company from Guangdong (Company A), and the defendants are Mr. Li and Chengdu certain industrial company (Company B), with the case being a contract dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 23 of the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China: If a company’s shareholders abuse the independent legal person status of the company and the limited liability of the shareholders to evade debts, causing serious harm to the interests of the company’s creditors, they shall bear joint and several liability for the company’s debts. If a shareholder uses two or more companies under its control to commit the acts specified in the preceding paragraph, each of the companies shall bear joint and several liability for the debts of any one of the companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-facts-of-the-case&#34;&gt;Basic Facts of the Case 
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff, Company A, claims that Defendant Mr. Li collected a “deposit” of 20 million yuan on behalf of Defendant Company B, and requests both defendants to return the principal of 20 million yuan and its interest after the contract expires. Defendant Company B argues that the 20 million yuan claimed by the plaintiff as a “deposit” has no factual or legal basis. The 20 million yuan is a one-time economic compensation paid by Plaintiff Company A to Defendant Company B based on the provisions of the “Memorandum,” and the plaintiff has no right to request its return. Defendant Mr. Li argues that the money he collected from the plaintiff was on behalf of Defendant Company B, and he should not bear any personal responsibility. Upon trial, it was found that on July 31, 2018, Defendant Mr. Li, on behalf of Defendant Company B, signed a “Memorandum” with the plaintiff, reaching an agreement on the cooperation of the pipe equipment automation order project: 1. Party A (Company B) agrees to limit sales to three parties (including domestic and international) within three years; 2. Party A shall provide comprehensive free services within three years, including training personnel, workshop layout, etc.; 3. Equipment spare parts shall be provided free of charge for one year, and spare parts at a low price thereafter until the plaintiff has mastered them; 4. Party B (plaintiff) shall have priority in enjoying the new products developed by Party A; 5. Party B shall place orders for all equipment from Party A at the same price within three years. On the same day, the plaintiff and Defendant Company B signed three “Order Contracts,” stipulating that the plaintiff shall order equipment from Company B, and the contract shall take effect upon payment of a 30% deposit. On August 1, 2018, Defendant Mr. Li issued a receipt to the plaintiff, stating “I have received a payment of 20 million yuan from Guangdong certain new materials group company for equipment.” Later, Mr. Li provided his personal bank account information for payment via WeChat to the plaintiff. On August 8, 2018, the plaintiff transferred 20 million yuan to the personal account provided by Defendant Mr. Li, noting it as payment for goods. At the same time, the plaintiff transferred the deposit for the above three contracts to the designated account of Defendant Company B using its company account. On that day, the plaintiff informed Mr. Li via WeChat that the equipment deposit of 674.88 yuan and 20 million yuan had been paid, and requested him to check. From 2018 to 2021, the plaintiff and Defendant Company B successively signed seven contracts, with a total contract amount of about 22 million yuan; during this period, they also involved matters such as the plaintiff commissioning Company B to purchase other equipment. In the lawsuit, both parties confirmed that except for the 20 million yuan in question, the rights and obligations stipulated in the “Order Contracts” had been performed or settled by agreement. During the transaction between the two parties, except for the receipt dated August 1, 2018, and the WeChat chat record dated August 8, 2018, there were no other written materials or chat records involving the 20 million yuan in question. It was found that Defendant Mr. Li was one of the shareholders of Defendant Company B and also the legal representative of the company; the personal account he used to collect the 20 million yuan in question was also used for the daily business income and expenses of Defendant Company B and Mr. Li’s personal income and expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disposition-of-the-case&#34;&gt;Disposition of the Case
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first-instance court rendered a judgment on April 26, 2023, ordering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendant Company B shall, within ten days of the effective date of this judgment, return 20 million yuan and its interest (calculated at the one-year loan market quoted rate published by the National Interbank Funding Center from January 5, 2023, until the actual date of return) to Plaintiff Company A;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendant Mr. Li shall bear joint and several liability for the aforementioned debt of Defendant Company B;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other claims of Plaintiff Company A are rejected. Both defendants were dissatisfied and filed an appeal. The second-instance court rendered a final judgment on November 1, 2023, upholding the original judgment and rejecting the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-from-the-case&#34;&gt;Lessons from the Case
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the details of the case, it is evident that the plaintiff made a payment of 20 million yuan based solely on a receipt from the legal representative of the counterparty in the contract, and the purpose of the funds mentioned on the receipt and noted on the remittance slip (payment for goods) was inconsistent with the plaintiff’s assertion in the lawsuit (deposit). Moreover, the WeChat conversations between the parties did not clearly specify the nature of the 20 million yuan, and neither the “Memorandum” nor the “Purchase and Sale Contract” mentioned it at all. This means that the plaintiff’s assertion that the 20 million yuan was a “deposit” is not directly proven by evidence. On the other hand, the defense and evidence presented by the defendants, claiming that the 20 million yuan was compensation for the patent technology or other services provided by them, combined with the specific content of the “Memorandum” signed by both parties, has a certain credibility. Therefore, whether the plaintiff can successfully recover the 20 million yuan in question is actually subject to significant litigation risks. The risks arise from the plaintiff’s pursuit of the convenience and efficiency of commercial transactions while neglecting the certainty and safety of such transactions. The court, after examining the statements of both the plaintiff and the defendant and analyzing the strength of their evidence, ultimately ruled in favor of the plaintiff company based on the preponderance of evidence. Additionally, in this case, Defendant Company B’s use of shareholder Mr. Li’s personal account for business operations is a common and prominent issue in commercial activities. Such actions blur the distinction between the personal property of the shareholder and the company’s property, undermining the corporate legal person’s statutory and necessary property independence, and thereby damaging the legitimate rights and interests of the company’s creditors. Therefore, Article 20, Paragraph 3 of the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China stipulates that if a company’s shareholders abuse the independent legal person status of the company and the limited liability of the shareholders to evade debts, causing serious harm to the interests of the company’s creditors, they shall bear joint and several liability for the company’s debts. Based on this, the court ordered Defendant Mr. Li to bear joint and several liability for Defendant Company B’s debt to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the plaintiff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-insights&#34;&gt;Research Insights
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is a common commercial contract dispute for small and medium-sized enterprises. The court, in a situation where both the plaintiff and the defendant held their own grounds, ruled for the defendant to return the funds based on the preponderance of evidence established after review. particularly, the court ordered the shareholder to bear joint and several liability when the defendant company’s assets were mixed with the personal property of the shareholder. This not only effectively protected the plaintiff’s litigious rights but also served as a typical example for enterprises and shareholders engaged in similar behaviors. Additionally, although the plaintiff ultimately won the lawsuit, the legal risks in the governance process of the plaintiff company are still worth noting. While pursuing business efficiency, enterprises should not neglect the certainty and safety of transactions. When conducting large-sum financial transactions, it is necessary to ensure that contract terms are clear and that the purpose of the funds is consistent with the contract content; a standardized retention mechanism should be established for evidence such as contracts, receipts, bank transfer records, and communication records during transactions, to be prepared for future needs; pre-emptive measures should be strengthened to prevent commercial legal risks, and compliance audits should be conducted for important business actions to ensure the legality of the actions and the integrity of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

I worked in the previous office building for 9 years, during which time I also changed several offices, but none of these moves were as impactful as the current one, which involves a complete relocation to a different building. Although the original office building was constructed in 1983, it was still adaptable to current office needs. However, the newly occupied office building, despite being built at a later time, has an interior that seems very serious and oppressive.&lt;/p&gt;

The theme of this forum was bankruptcy and the rule of law. The event featured two top experts in the field of bankruptcy law in China: Professor Li Shuguang from China University of Political Science and Law, and Professor Xu Yangguang from Renmin University of China. In addition, Judge Ding Haihu, an expert in bankruptcy adjudication from the High People&amp;rsquo;s Court of Guangdong Province, was also invited to speak at the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I participated in our company&amp;rsquo;s union activity and went to Zhaoqing Ziyun Cave Scenic Area with my colleagues. It is a relatively niche attraction with not many tourists, but the scenery is quite beautiful. Additionally, it is conveniently located near the city, making transportation relatively easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Very lucky to registered an Oracle Cloud service account</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/successfully-registered-an-oracle-cloud-service-account/images/R-C-1.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Very lucky to registered an Oracle Cloud service account" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, I had been using Alibaba Cloud servers registered with a promotional offer, with a configuration of 2 CPU cores and 2GB of memory. However, since that product is about to expire and I cannot continue to renew it with the promotional offer, I don&amp;rsquo;t plan on using it anymore. So, during this time, I have been searching on the Nodeseek forum to find a cloud server with a suitable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/successfully-registered-an-oracle-cloud-service-account/images/103-1P3221HU2P6-1024x576.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alibaba cloud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, I saw someone on the forum post a promotional offer for a cloud server operated by an individual seller. They were offering a cloud server with 1 CPU core and 1GB of memory for only 1 Chinese Yuan per month. However, many comments below mentioned that these types of cloud servers have extremely poor performance and may become unusable after a while. They suggested trying to register for an Oracle Cloud service account instead, as they offer free cloud servers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I decided to give registering for an Oracle Cloud service account a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first registered, I entered my personal information and contact address in English and attempted to verify using my Visa credit card from China Construction Bank. As expected, the verification failed. Then, I searched online and found many discussions where people mentioned that registering for an Oracle Cloud service account is a mysterious problem because there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be any consistent pattern. Some even mentioned trying for one or two years without success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a &amp;ldquo;give it a try&amp;rdquo; attitude, on my second attempt, I decided to abandon any clever methods. I directly registered using Chinese information, provided the most common QQ email account in China, and chose a server location far from my place, in Hyderabad, India. For verification, I used my Mastercard from Guangfa Bank. Miraculously, it was successful this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I shared this information on the forum, many people still didn&amp;rsquo;t believe it. Orz.&lt;br&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it seems 1 physical core and 1 virtual thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Cloud service accounts provide two types of free servers by default: traditional x86 servers and ARM servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my blog website requires minimal resources, I chose to use a 1 CPU core and 1GB memory x86 server. I installed the Ubuntu system and BT panel and set up Litespeed, PHP, and MySQL. It looks promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I have time, I&amp;rsquo;ll try using Oracle&amp;rsquo;s free 4 CPU core and 24GB memory ARM server to build a Mastodon application.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Today I changed all four tires for my SUV</title>

        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/today-i-changed-all-four-tires-for-my-suv/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/today-i-changed-all-four-tires-for-my-suv/images/IMG_20231031_065851.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Today I changed all four tires for my SUV" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a Chinese brand SUV that I purchased in 2017. I mainly use it for commuting to work and driving my kids around. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve been driving it for six years and the mileage is only 50,000 kilometers. However, the tire treads were worn out, so I decided to replace all four tires. The original tires were German brand Continental, size 235/55/R18, but they were quite expensive, costing around 700 Chinese yuan per tire. So, for all four tires, it would have been 2,800 Chinese yuan. That&amp;rsquo;s why this time I opted for Chinese brand tires of the same size, which only cost 1,000 Chinese yuan for all four. It was a more affordable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/today-i-changed-all-four-tires-for-my-suv/images/IMG_20231029_224027-575x1024.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodo try to move the tire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the tire replacement process, I noticed that the connection points between the four wheel axles and the tires were rusty. So, apart from installing the new tires, I also had them treated for rust and performed a four-wheel alignment. As a result, the total payment came to around 1,300 yuan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rusty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these tires are cheaper, the manufacturer still provides a considerate three-year warranty. In addition, the sales platform also offers a three-year accident subsidy. For example, if the tires develop bulges, the sales platform can provide an additional 80% reimbursement of the purchase price.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/what-does-being-35-years-old-actually-mean/images/IMG_20231024_220627.jpg" alt="Featured image of post What does being 35 years old actually mean?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is my wife CC&amp;rsquo;s 35th birthday, and in a few months, I will also turn 35. In recent years, the &amp;ldquo;phenomenon of being 35&amp;rdquo; has undoubtedly been a very popular topic in China. Taking this opportunity, I would like to briefly share my views on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first heard about the &amp;ldquo;phenomenon of being 35&amp;rdquo; around 2009. It was during the summer vacation of my college years when I stayed at my cousin&amp;rsquo;s house in Changsha, Hunan. He told me that he was preparing to apply for the Hunan Provincial Civil Service Exam. However, being born in 1980, he was already approaching 30 years old, and if he couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass the exam, he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have many opportunities to apply because the age limit for the civil service exam was 35 years old and below. I was quite surprised to hear about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin had always been a role model for me in terms of academics. Throughout his educational journey, he always excelled. He successfully enrolled at Xiangtan University in 2000 and earned a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Control Engineering from Wuhan University of Science and Technology in 2004. After graduating in 2007, he joined Sany Heavy Industry, which was the best private company in Hunan Province at that time and also one of the largest construction machinery manufacturing companies globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The income my cousin earned at Sany Heavy Industry astonished me. However, he told me that he would rather find a government position with a much lower income than continue working at the company. The reason was that the work pressure at the company was too high, and internal competition was extremely intense. If he couldn&amp;rsquo;t transition from a technical position to a managerial position before the age of 35, there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be many good career prospects for him. So, he preferred to take a government position as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his application for the government exam, an absurd incident occurred. The online registration system required applicants to submit a personal photo, which had to be one inch in size and with a maximum file size of 30KB. This meant compressing the photo to the extreme, leading to frequent failures in photo submission. The photo would either become too blurry due to excessive compression or fail to meet the size requirements. It took many attempts before he finally succeeded in uploading an appropriate photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, my cousin successfully passed the professional technical recruitment exam organized by the Hunan Provincial Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision in 2009. He was assigned to the Quality and Technical Supervision Bureau in Zhuzhou City. Later on, he also secured a permanent position in this unit and gradually grew into a senior engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my cousin&amp;rsquo;s situation gave me a preliminary understanding of the &amp;ldquo;phenomenon of being 35,&amp;rdquo; the following case left a deep impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2014, after I started working, there has been a female colleague in the same office. She was born in 1985 but wasn&amp;rsquo;t good at exams, so she worked in our unit as a temporary employee. (Although she was considered a temporary employee, I have never seen any government department actively dismiss anyone unless they voluntarily resigned.) This female colleague, through arduous efforts, finally passed the civil service exam at the end of 2018 after years of trying. However, to reduce the difficulty, the job she obtained was located in a relatively remote area about 120 kilometers away from our place. By the time she passed the probationary period, she was almost 35 years old, as she had turned 34 when she became a civil servant. According to the government department&amp;rsquo;s internal transfer rules, which also have an age limit of 35 and below, she had almost no chance of returning to work in her hometown. Unless she gave up her civil servant status and resigned to seek another career, but this would be an unwise decision in China, especially for older women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning the rules regarding internal job transfers within Chinese government agencies. Before 2021, it was relatively easy for employees in my city to transfer to different positions. Any civil servant within the territory of China, as long as they were below the age of 35 and met the basic requirements in terms of terms of education and specialization for the desired position, theoretically had the opportunity to transfer. Since my city is located in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, with relatively high salaries and good working environments, many local residents who wanted to work in the government sector would usually choose to pass the civil service exam in a less competitive area, such as remote mountainous regions, and then transfer back to the major cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this indirect approach has become increasingly difficult to achieve since 2021, as the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee issued new regulations that have largely closed this loophole.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new regulations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the &amp;ldquo;phenomenon of being 35&amp;rdquo; has shifted from an internal government regulation to a misconception that has spread to the societal level, particularly in large IT and internet companies. Many people believe that they may face unemployment once they reach the age of 35. Of course, this may also be related to China&amp;rsquo;s demographic dividend. Some major corporations believe that individuals who have been with the company for a long time are more likely to become complacent and fail to keep up with market changes and technological advancements. On the other hand, young people who continuously flock to major cities in search of job opportunities are seen as more dynamic and driven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle-aged individuals often face challenges in the job market and find it difficult to secure new positions that match their previous jobs in terms of status and benefits. They often have to settle for lower-quality jobs to meet their basic living needs. Many of them experience a strong sense of crisis in their careers and fear unemployment. As a result, they become extremely competitive internally, extending their working hours without limits to demonstrate their loyalty to their work and the value they bring to the company. Even when faced with demanding requirements or tendencies towards abusive behavior from the company or management, they are willing to endure it, as the pressures of life and family force them to compromise their dignity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;extremely competitive internally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, for the majority of society, the age of 35 is considered the golden age for work. People in this age group have matured mentally and have accumulated a great deal of work experience. They possess a strong sense of social responsibility and family responsibility. I also hope that our society can have less age discrimination, so that everyone has a fair opportunity for growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our generation has experienced tremendous social changes and carries immense social pressure. When I was a child, my family was very poor. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until 1998 that we bought our first black and white television. Throughout the 1990s, my parents&amp;rsquo; annual income was probably less than $300, and we lived in extreme poverty. This was the living situation for the majority of people in my hometown at that time. So personally, I care a lot about the certainty of life. I believe that maintaining a stable job is of utmost importance. The pressures of family and life leave me with limited choices to make mistakes, because one wrong step could lead to continuous and permanent losses for my family and myself. Even though the combined annual income of my wife and me is more than 200 times what my parents used to earn, I still worry about this issue. Of course, this way of thinking may also be a shared sentiment among many Chinese people, otherwise the civil service examination in China would not be so popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the topography and geomorphology of my hometown village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often imagine what kind of life I would have if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t studied hard when I was young and didn&amp;rsquo;t get into university. Or if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t chosen to work in the court and instead continued to seek employment in society, what kind of job status would I be in now? Perhaps I would be running a small company like some of my cousins of the same age, working as a laborer in the manufacturing industry, or doing small business in Southeast Asia or even Africa. Maybe I would be like some of my classmates from college, already a successful lawyer or working as a legal or HR manager in a small or medium-sized enterprise. I might even continue to work in advertising companies or telecommunication enterprises in the field of marketing. But in the end, life has no &amp;ldquo;what ifs.&amp;rdquo; Since I have chosen the current career path, I can only resolutely continue on this path. This is also the helpless choice of our generation&amp;rsquo;s fate.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the largest legal information provider and the most influential professional legal media group in China. It was renamed from the &amp;ldquo;Legal System Daily&amp;rdquo; in 2020. Being able to have an article published in this newspaper can be considered a fortunate coincidence and a very rare opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started working, I have published many articles in various newspapers and magazines, including the &amp;ldquo;Changan&amp;rdquo; magazine of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the &amp;ldquo;Democracy and Rule of Law&amp;rdquo; weekly of the China Law Society, the &amp;ldquo;Democracy and Rule of Law&amp;rdquo; newspaper, the &amp;ldquo;Southern Daily&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Southern Rule of Law Report&amp;rdquo; in Guangdong Province, as well as our local &amp;ldquo;Foshan Daily&amp;rdquo; and various internal publications. Today, while chatting with a friend on WeChat, I talked about my past experience in writing, and I realized that writing is not as difficult as I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal Daily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before entering my current position in August 2014, I had never published any articles in mainstream media. Many of the work summaries and materials in my previous job were simply copied from colleagues&amp;rsquo; work reports found on search engines, with slight modifications to complete the tasks. At that time, I had no concept of writing formal and serious articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the writing standards of government documents, we need to write in Microsoft Office or WPS Office using A4 paper format, and there are strict formatting requirements. For example, the margins should be 3.7 cm at the top, 3.5 cm at the bottom, 2.8 cm on the left, and 2.6 cm on the right. The title of the article must be written in the second font size using the FangZheng XiaoBiao Song font. The content of the article must use the third font size with the FangZheng FangSong-GB2312 font. The first-level headings must use the third font size in bold, and the second-level headings must use the third font size in bold with the Kai font. There are also specific requirements for line spacing and paragraphs, including the maximum number of characters per line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chang&amp;rsquo;an Magazine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I started writing, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know all of this. I was used to using code editors like VSCode or Notepad++ for writing, and I saved files in TXT format. I felt that the characters in code editors were smaller, making it easier to read directly on the screen, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about text formatting. Additionally, I used the WordPad application in Windows for writing. I still have many RTF files saved on my office computer to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the content formatting of the article was adjusted, I used to like saving files in the XPS format in Windows. Many of my colleagues&amp;rsquo; computers didn&amp;rsquo;t have PDF readers installed at that time, but XPS readers were built-in on Windows and could be opened without the need for additional software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I published an article in a formal magazine was in September 2014, which was about a month after I started my current position. It was published in an internal publication called &amp;ldquo;Foshan Research.&amp;rdquo; The file versions that I still have on my computer are in the XPS format that was used back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Chinese government agencies, one important factor in evaluating the quality of work is whether it has received positive coverage in mainstream media or has been recommended and reprinted as an exemplary case in internal publications. Therefore, many government departments prioritize hiring staff who are skilled in writing articles. Sometimes, similar to the publication fees required for many academic papers, some government agencies have to allocate specific funds to publish positive articles in mainstream media. However, in all my years of work, I have never had to spend money to publish an article in this way because the department I work for simply does not have that budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democracy and Legal Magazine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To effectively publish articles in mainstream media, here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of my own experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first point is to stay up-to-date with current affairs. For example, in 2017, I published an article in &amp;ldquo;Chang&amp;rsquo;an&amp;rdquo; magazine focusing on strengthening the protection of the rights of young people. At that time, there were several severe criminal cases targeting minors in China. I analyzed the causes of those cases and combined them with effective local practices and experiences in protecting minors, providing targeted suggestions and recommendations. After I sent the article to the editor-in-chief&amp;rsquo;s email at the magazine, it was quickly accepted and published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point is to maintain a friendly relationship with journalists and editors if you aim to publish articles in a specific publication on an ongoing basis. For instance, over the years, I have maintained a very friendly relationship with the Guangdong Journalist Station of Democracy and Legal News Agency, frequently communicating with them about the current topics they are focusing on. Based on their needs, I see if I can provide relevant news leads and materials. If there is a suitable article, it is usually easier to get it published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third point is to consider the length of the article before submission and provide appropriate versions accordingly. For example, before publishing an article in the &amp;ldquo;Legal Daily,&amp;rdquo; I carefully studied the layout and length requirements of the newspaper. Generally, they accept articles of 2500, 1500, 800, or 200 words. Before being sure if the article would be accepted, I prepared four different versions of the article corresponding to these lengths. This way, if the editor decides to use the article, they don&amp;rsquo;t need to make further edits or modifications, saving them time in typesetting. Luckily, they chose the 2500-word version I provided this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, it is quite fulfilling to publish articles in mainstream media during one&amp;rsquo;s spare time. These articles are usually permanently preserved and can be found in serious academic and journal databases. They are also easily searchable on search engines, leaving a lasting memory for oneself in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>How many holidays do I have each year?</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/how-many-holidays-do-i-have-each-year/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/how-many-holidays-do-i-have-each-year/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/how-many-holidays-do-i-have-each-year/images/E5889BE5AEA2E8B4B4E8AEBEE8AEA1_1695734327328_20230926.png" alt="Featured image of post How many holidays do I have each year?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two days, we will soon have the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday, which totals 8 days. Today, I heard in an internal meeting that government departments predict that this holiday will be much livelier than previous years, and the number of people traveling may increase by more than 20% compared to 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic. So, I want to take this opportunity to assess how many holidays I currently have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    1.Annual Leave: 10 days&lt;br&gt;
    I have been working for over 12 years now, and according to the regulations, after working for 10 years, I am entitled to 10 days of annual leave, and after 20 years, it increases to 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    2.Home Leave: 5 days&lt;br&gt;
    Since my mother lives in the countryside, which is over 800 kilometers away from my current workplace, I can have a home leave every four years to visit her, and the duration is 20 days. On average, it&amp;rsquo;s five days per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   3. Care Leave: 5 days&lt;br&gt;
    As an only child, I have five days of care leave each year to take care of the elderly at home. If my parents are hospitalized, this leave can be extended to 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    4.Statutory Holidays: 11 days&lt;br&gt;
    Currently, China has 11 statutory holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    5.Weekends: 104 days off&lt;br&gt;
    Saturdays and Sundays make up 104 days off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, I have 135 days of leave, which accounts for 37% of the year, and the number of working days per year is 230.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/how-many-holidays-do-i-have-each-year/images/E5889BE5AEA2E8B4B4E8AEBEE8AEA1_1695734787511_20230926.png&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;100&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;240px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also other types of leave, such as maternity leave, marriage leave, childcare leave, bereavement leave, sick leave, personal leave, and so on, but currently, I am unable to enjoy most of these leaves. For example, parents are entitled to an additional ten days of childcare leave each year until their child turns three, but my child is already five years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that many of these leaves are only available to those working in government departments or state-owned enterprises. Employees in private or foreign-owned enterprises may have different vacation policies. Especially in some small private companies, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult for employees to have their leave effectively guaranteed. For instance, many small companies adopt a working pattern of 12 hours a day and six days a week. Apart from the eleven statutory holidays mandated by the government, it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to enjoy other personal leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, as China is still the world&amp;rsquo;s largest developing country, there is still a significant gap in terms of workers&amp;rsquo; holiday protection compared to developed countries in Europe and America. However, this issue has gained widespread attention from the government and society, and I believe there should be significant improvements in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

Taking advantage of the weekend, I visited two college classmates who are lawyers in Shenzhen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/visited-two-college-classmates-who-are-lawyers/images/IMG_20230924_204849-1024x767.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of lawyer&amp;rsquo;s office&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, graduates with a major in law have several main employment channels, including courts, procuratorates, administrative law enforcement agencies, and law firms. Among them, law firms are usually the most popular choice of employment because they do not require participation in the highly challenging civil service examination. In our class, out of 40 classmates, seven of them joined law firms after graduation. However, two of them later switched to government legal departments, and now there are five remaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/visited-two-college-classmates-who-are-lawyers/images/IMG_20230924_205050-767x1024.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a lawyer is a rapidly growing profession that demands high individual capabilities. Of my two classmates who are lawyers in Shenzhen, one became a partner in a small law firm due to obtaining the lawyer&amp;rsquo;s practicing certificate early. Currently, the law firm has around ten lawyers. The other classmate joined a very large law firm, which was recognized as an excellent law firm nationwide in 2021. It has approximately 100 lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/visited-two-college-classmates-who-are-lawyers/images/IMG_20230924_204939-702x1024.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a larger firm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the communication with my two classmates, I had three main thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current year of 2023, the legal profession still generally relies on personal family background. If individuals have good social connections and a certain amount of capital accumulation, pursuing a career in law can be relatively smooth. However, if personal family conditions are difficult, it is very challenging to establish oneself as a lawyer in a major city. It requires several times more effort than others to have a chance of achieving some degree of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal industry in China is undergoing a significant transformation. The traditional model where individual lawyers take on cases as independent agents (essentially being their own bosses) is being squeezed by the &amp;ldquo;salary system&amp;rdquo; employed by large law firms. In this model, lawyers work as employees of the law firm and receive relatively fixed compensation. Currently, the largest law firm in China has 15,000 lawyers, and even smaller law firms are actively expanding and moving towards corporate operation models. Most young lawyers work for senior lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legal profession in large cities has become highly competitive. For example, in the city of Shenzhen where these two classmates are located, there are already over 20,000 lawyers, with a ratio of 1 lawyer per 1,000 residents, similar to the situation in the UK. Due to the relatively low litigation costs in China, a large portion of civil litigation cases do not require the involvement of lawyers. In criminal cases, if the defendant cannot afford a lawyer, the government will provide a designated lawyer for free defense. This significantly suppresses the demand for legal services. As a result, the income of lawyers in China cannot be compared to countries like the UK and the US. With more people in the profession, the share of the income pie for each individual becomes smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>A wonderful experience working in the procuratorate</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/a-wonderful-experience-working-in-the-procuratorate/images/IMG_20230909_184227.jpg" alt="Featured image of post A wonderful experience working in the procuratorate" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was very honored to go to the procuratorate of a city as the leader of a working group to carry out a special work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our working group consists of 15 people, including senior judges, prosecutors and legal professionals. The main task of the working group is to conduct a comprehensive inspection and evaluation of criminal justice cases handled by courts, procuratorates and public security bureaus throughout the city last year, as well as administrative law enforcement cases handled by government administrative departments such as the Natural Resources Bureau, the Ecology and Environment Bureau, and the Health Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first time working in the procuratorate, and I am deeply impressed by the good working atmosphere and advanced office facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Procuratorate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Constitution of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China, the main duties of the procuratorate are to supervise the implementation of laws, including civil, criminal and administrative proceedings, and have the same status as courts in state institutions. At the same time, the procuratorate is also one of the main participants in criminal proceedings, responsible for supervising the criminal filing and investigation work of the public security organs, prosecuting criminal cases on behalf of the state, supervising the criminal trial work of the courts, and proposing public interest litigation on behalf of the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2018 reform of state institutions, the functions of the procuratorate were somewhat weakened. After 2018, most of the investigation responsibilities for job-related crimes were transferred to the National Supervision Commission, and the procuratorate only retained the investigation duties for job-related crimes committed by judicial personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I feel that the procuratorate is a very serious office space, all prosecutors are very smart and intelligent, they are very rigorous and serious in their work, and they are very well managed on many details, otherwise it is difficult to win in the lawyer&amp;rsquo;s nitpicky defense. During this inspection, we saw that most of the criminal cases charged by the procuratorate, including the charges, criminal facts and sentencing recommendations, can be accepted by the court, and more than 80% of criminal suspects can actively admit guilt. The vast majority of criminal cases with unclear facts and insufficient evidence have been rejected by the procuratorate and cannot enter the court trial stage; In a small number of cases, after the prosecution is instituted and before the court begins, because the lawyer discovers that there are obvious problems in the case, the procuratorate will also withdraw the prosecution or modify the prosecution. In the end, less than 10 percent of the verdicts in cases are inconsistent with the content of the procuratorate&amp;rsquo;s prosecution, and once such a case occurs, the procuratorate has special departments and personnel to study these problems, and through repeated study and discussion, try to avoid the continuation of such problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a judge or prosecutor is a dream that all of us legal professionals have, but because of the nature of my current job, this idea may never come.I have to say this is a regret.&lt;/p&gt;

Initially, I planned to drive my own car, but then I discovered that the office had an unused official vehicle, so I applied to use it for work purposes. It&amp;rsquo;s an old car, over 20 years old, a 1997 Toyota Land Cruiser with a 2.7L V6 engine and AT tires. It&amp;rsquo;s the type of car that makes all sorts of noises except for the horn. Since driving became quite monotonous, I ended up bringing a Bose Bluetooth portable speaker and connected it to my phone to play music. Surprisingly, the overall effect was pretty good. It turns out that as long as the speaker volume is loud, road noise, wind noise, and various interior noises are not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, when I went to pick up Hehe from school, I was a few minutes late. She had a displeased expression on her face and complained that the other classmates had already left on the school bus. She asked why I was late and requested to take the school bus instead. On the way back home, I also thought about it. I have to make four trips to school every day, which adds up to 80 kilometers. If we calculate for a semester of 100 days, it would be 8000 kilometers. Considering the current price of gasoline, the fuel expenses alone for this semester would amount to 5000 yuan. So, I reluctantly agreed to her suggestion of taking the school bus. Later, I realized that the cost of the school bus was also not cheap, amounting to 2500 yuan per semester.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>After 11 years, returning to work at the court again</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/after-11-years-returning-to-work-at-the-court-again/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/after-11-years-returning-to-work-at-the-court-again/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/after-11-years-returning-to-work-at-the-court-again/images/IMG_20230904_222922-scaled.jpg" alt="Featured image of post After 11 years, returning to work at the court again" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;By chance I had an opportunity return to work at the court recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it&amp;rsquo;s not a permanent position, but rather a temporary job lasting only a month, it&amp;rsquo;s still a valuable experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my fourth time working at a court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time was during my sophomore year of college when I interned at a district court near our university for a month, primarily involved in judgment execution work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second time was during my senior year of college when I chose to intern at another district court near our university for three months, also focusing on judgment execution work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last month before graduating from college, I started working at a district court in the city where the university is located (the city has a total of five district courts), where I experienced the first part of my career, which lasted about 18 months. The first three months were the most painful period, because my salary was only 1,700 yuan, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to buy a BlackBerry phone. After that, I passed the exam to become a judicial assistant, although the salary is only about 5,000 yuan, but with other benefits, the total annual income can reach the level of 100,000 yuan.During this time, because of the nature of being an assistant, I did not need to compete with other colleagues in my work, but only needed to complete my own work tasks, so I had a very happy time for more than a year, and it also made me deeply love court work. This period of my career at the Court was also the happiest period of my work and life in all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my work contract from 2011 when I worked at the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it has been eleven years since I last worked at the court, returning this time felt very familiar and nostalgic. For example, due to the confidentiality requirements of many court tasks, the court utilizes a dedicated internal network. As soon as I arrived at the court this time, I immediately found the internal website I used during my previous work at the court and was pleasantly surprised to discover an electronic magazine that I had edited back then. However, this is the only trace I could find of my past work at that court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronic magazine that I edited while working at another court in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been quite eventful in the eleven years since I left the court in 2012. Returning to the court has allowed me to see many issues that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of before. There are significant differences between the court I had in mind and the reality I encountered, mainly in a few aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court work environment tends to be more isolated. Due to the relatively independent nature of court work, court personnel often have limited interactions with other government departments and members of society. Their perspectives and problem-solving approaches may differ from those of the general public, leading to a certain degree of social functioning deficit. For example, during this experience, we discovered that some judges were sued by their neighbors due to their inability to handle neighborhood disputes effectively. Others lacked social experience when dealing with simple litigation cases arising from family, school, or workplace conflicts due to their limited participation in social activities. Additionally, some young judges, who assumed judicial roles in their early twenties, lacked personal experience in relationships, marriage, and divorce but had to mediate divorce cases for others, resulting in complaints from the parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a higher proportion of women working in the courts. In China, due to law being categorized as a humanities discipline, there tend to be more female students studying law, while male students mostly choose science and engineering majors. As a result, there is a higher proportion of women working in the courts. In the four courts I have experienced, the proportion of female staff is generally above 60%. In the court I recently visited, among employees born after 1980, approximately 70% are women. It&amp;rsquo;s commonly believed that women are more inclined towards sensitivity in terms of personality, while men lean towards rationality. However, law itself leans towards rationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid growth of litigation cases in the courts is indeed a concerning trend. The current efficiency of the courts, with an average case processing time of 60 days for civil cases and 20 days for criminal cases, has contributed to this increase. Additionally, the low cost of litigation, where most cases are charged at 1% of the claim amount and many cases don&amp;rsquo;t require hiring a lawyer, has made the process more accessible to individuals. It has become as simple as submitting pre-litigation documents and evidence to the court, akin to applying for a visa.These convenient conditions have led to a significant surge in litigation cases in the past decade. In my city, for example, there has been an average of one litigation case for every 30 people annually. It seems that citizens&amp;rsquo; initial inclination when encountering disputes is to file a lawsuit in court.While the accessibility and efficiency of the court system are positive aspects, the rapid growth of litigation cases also highlights the importance of alternative dispute resolution methods. Encouraging mediation and other forms of dispute resolution can help alleviate the burden on the courts and provide more flexible and tailored solutions for the parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese courts have implemented numerous performance indicators. Prior to the year 2000, there were significant incidents of wrongful convictions and miscarriages of justice in Chinese courts, which had a profound negative impact. In the past decade or so, the higher courts have introduced a myriad of performance indicators to ensure the fairness of judgments and balance the judicial process. However, this has also led to a phenomenon where judges prioritize meeting these indicators above all else during case proceedings.For example, in order to curb the rapid growth of litigation cases, the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Court set a target of reducing the number of cases by 5% this year. As a result, many courts have established thresholds at the filing stage, requiring most cases to undergo mediation by judges before proceeding to litigation. If successful, the cases can be resolved without going to trial. However, in reality, the workload of judges has not decreased. On the contrary, the difficulty of mediating many cases has resulted in a significant waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the court is still a highly desirable place of employment. The working atmosphere is harmonious, and the infrastructure and office environment are excellent. However, all of this will come to an end as my current assignment concludes. Fortunately, I will be starting a new job at a different prosecutor&amp;rsquo;s office next month. In China, the courts and prosecutor&amp;rsquo;s offices are relatively independent departments, and they share many similarities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/how-to-design-a-network-storage-solution-for-family-photos/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-design-a-network-storage-solution-for-family-photos/images/N1-scaled-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post How to design a network storage solution for a large number of family photos" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, as the number of personal electronic documents and photos has grown, I personally currently have roughly 40GB of Office files containing nearly 100,000 DOC documents and countless excel files. My family has over 120,000 files of photos and videos stored, containing jpg cr2 heiv heif mp4 avi and various other formats, which is about 700GB after removing duplicate files.Recently, I re-adjusted some of the cloud storage products and services. Here is how I design a solution for network storage aticles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;clear-about-the-type-of-device-you-have&#34;&gt;Clear about the type of device you have
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;be clear about the type of device you have&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, the main electronic products and network services I am using personally and at home are as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have three main cell phones currently in use at home, namely Huawei P40 Pro ,Vivo X80, Huawei mate 20. I need to meet the demand for each phone to be able to view all the photos of my family anytime and anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently have three computers at home, namely Lenovo Y9000p, Thinkpad P53, Intel NUC12, all equipped with 4K resolution monitors, corresponding to the needs of games, work and network video respectively. In addition there are iPad Pro and vivo pad and other tablet computers, often need to pass files to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have other digital cameras at home, which probably produce about 200GB of photos and videos per year and need secure storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two TVs at home, TCL 75-inch and Sony 65-inch, both with 4K resolution, which need to meet the demand for large bandwidth video viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Synology small NAS at home that can store 4TB of data, but it uses a 2.5-inch hard drive version with lower performance because it needs to be stuffed into a weak box. In addition, I have two Netgear routers at home with a third-party modified version of the Merlin system, which can readily mount large-capacity removable hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family uses China Mobile&amp;rsquo;s family mobile data package service, which includes more than 100GB of network traffic per month, which can meet the daily needs of using cell phones to link to cloud storage for uploading and downloading files at any time. In addition, China Mobile also gives 1000Mbps home fiber broadband, which has a download speed of 100MB/s and an upload speed of 5MB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-design-a-network-storage-solution-for-family-photos/images/nas-jpg.webp&#34;
	width=&#34;742&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;236&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;567px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive analysis reveals that the biggest problem at present is that my family uses various brands and platforms of smart devices. The cell phone is mainly android platform and Huawei Harmony OS based on android platform, the computer has both windows system and Android and IOS system, and the TV is all Android system. In this case, it is difficult for me to solve my needs through a single cloud storage method. One possible idea is to replace all the major devices I am using with the same brand and the same platform. For example, replacing the Vivo phone I&amp;rsquo;m currently using with a Huawei phone. However, the main reason why I am buying a Vivo phone in 2022 is that Huawei was unjustifiably sanctioned by the U.S., which prevented the 5G chip it designed from being produced, and all the phones on sale are 4G versions. I had to buy a non-Huawei branded 5G phone because the 4G network speed was hard to satisfy me. But this problem will probably be solved in the next few years with the rapid progress of photolithography and chip manufacturing technology in mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;break-down-your-needs-into-the-specialized-terms&#34;&gt;Break down your needs into the specialized terms
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;break down your needs into the specialized terms&lt;/strong&gt; that correspond to cloud storage services. For example, my personal and family needs can be summarized as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;high-capacity storage space: photo storage services of 1TB or more;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;multi-platform sharing: compatible with Android/Windows/IOS and other platforms;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;intranet high-speed transfer: support CloudSync of Synology NAS; (WebDav and other unofficial and unstable ways are not considered)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;extranet high-speed transfer: support 20MB/S download service and 5MB/s upload service;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;security and privacy: integrity of data preservation and reliable privacy protection;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;document management: professional Office document management;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;album management: professional photo management;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;intelligent photo albums: automatic photo organization by means of artificial intelligence;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;efficient search: providing text \OCR\ intelligent recognition search;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;suitable cost: affordable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;look-for-a-network-storage-service-that-corresponds-to-your-needs&#34;&gt;look for a network storage service that corresponds to your needs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, &lt;strong&gt;look for a network storage service that corresponds to your needs&lt;/strong&gt;. Here, I briefly list some of the storage services I have used in the last 10 years:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Synology NAS Ds416slim 4*2TB (available capacity 4TB), mainly used to store family photos and videos. one-time purchase cost in 2017 was RMB 4,000, no plans to update in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;115.com cloud storage.115.com cloud storage 80TB, mainly used to store illegal resources on the Internet. 2014 one-time purchase cost is RMB 400 (2014-2024), no renewal plan after expiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onedrive Home Edition 6TB , mainly used to store online books and photos and videos, etc. Microsoft 365 Home Edition, annual cost of 220 RMB, ongoing subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei Cloud 2TB, used only to backup Huawei cell phone photos and videos. Costs 750 RMB per year, renewal cancelled in March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aliyun Cloud 2TB, used only for downloading movies, TV shows and other web resources. Free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu Cloud 2TB , used only for downloading web resources. Free of charge, with occasional paid usage at 30 RMB per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChinaMobile Cloud 9TB, only used to backup home files. Limited free (because I am a China Mobile mobile data package user, free gift).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WPS Cloud 1TB for WPS Office document storage only. 2019 one-time purchase cost is RMB 600 (2019-2029), current renewal fee is RMB 250 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iCloud, a 200GB version was previously purchased during the family&amp;rsquo;s use of iPhones and has not been used since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long time of using the above products and services, here I briefly talk about the experience of using them. At the same time, I also made a table to list my scoring of these products and services, and as my personal decision basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-synology-nas&#34;&gt;1. Synology NAS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAS is my largest one-time investment in storage, and the value of its use is undeniable. There are mainly the following conveniences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The storage capacity is large enough to store all the important family files conveniently, and it has strong privacy, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about leaking personal privacy. In terms of data security, I set up two sets of Raid 1 for the four hard drives and manually back up important data to the removable drive from time to time so that I can recover the data even if the drive is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. You can easily backup to a network drive. For example, NAS files can be synchronized and backed up to cloud storage such as Baidu Cloud and Onedrive via the built-in CloudSync program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. High-speed file transfer within the home is possible. NAS folders can be mounted to any computer and smartphone, tablet, or TV at home via protocols such as Samba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are very big limitations in using Synology NAS in home use, especially in China&amp;rsquo;s network environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Currently, most of the home broadband users in China are using shared IPv4 pools, and there is no fixed IPv4, so there is no way to open NAS files quickly on networks outside the home. You need to use a third party network penetration service, which increases the cost of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Although Synology provides Quick connect, an external network access service, the reliability of this service is not high in China, and the speed of file transfer is less than 500KB/s, which is less practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. China&amp;rsquo;s home broadband is an asymmetric network, the 1Gbps fiber optic network I am currently using at home, although the downlink speed can reach more than 100MB/s, but the maximum upload speed of files is only 5MB/s, which is difficult to achieve high-speed file outgoing transmission. operators usually limit the upload speed of home users&amp;rsquo; network to about 30-40Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. In China&amp;rsquo;s network environment, currently large files (e.g., 4K videos, TV episodes, etc.) are usually downloaded using network hard disk mode. In actual use, network drives such as Aliyun Cloud , ChinaMobile Cloud, etc. provide TV/PC clients directly to provide 4K video online viewing services. Unless the individual has a strong collection fetish, it is already very unwise to download video and TV episode files to local viewing. This also further compresses the limitations of NAS usage, making it more focused on internal home file usage rather than an aid for using network files.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-115-cloud&#34;&gt;2. 115 Cloud
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to personal observation, most of the users who use 115 cloud storage are storing illegal video files. For example: pirated pornographic videos, pirated movies, etc. The following advantages are available when storing these files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Large capacity. 115 Cloud provided unlimited storage space for some paid users before 2014, which could be obtained using lower cost at that time. I did not purchase the unlimited space service back then, but I purchased a 10-year regular membership for RMB 40 per year to get access to 80TB of space. The current membership renewal offer is around 200 RMB per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Fast speed. 115 Cloud download speed is about 200Mbps, which is enough for daily use, because even 4K video online only needs 100Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Easy to upload files. 115 Cloud can easily store files using magnet links, bt seed files, SHA1 collisions, etc. There are plenty of such resources available in some websites. For example, just by providing a magnet link of the top 500 movies in imdb list, you can store HD video files of 500 movies to the user&amp;rsquo;s 115 Cloud folder in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. The most strange thing is that in the strictly regulated environment, it is almost impossible for the cloud storage services of Internet giants such as Baidu Alibaba to provide any chance of illegal file storage, but 115 Cloud always runs stably. Needless to say, this is strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-design-a-network-storage-solution-for-family-photos/images/Screenshot_20230418_144103-461x1024.webp&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 115 Cloud storage wanders on the edge of illegality, its biggest flaw is always the security issue, and it may simply announce its closure during some future crackdown organized by the government on the distribution of illegal files. I believe no user would dare to store important data on such a network drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-onedrive&#34;&gt;3. Onedrive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onedrive has two kinds of storage in China, one is stored in mainland China, operated by Vnet, mainly for business users; the other is stored in Hong Kong or Singapore, operated by Microsoft itself, mainly for personal services. The main advantages are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-design-a-network-storage-solution-for-family-photos/images/Screenshot_20230418_144114-461x1024.webp&#34;
	width=&#34;461&#34;
	height=&#34;1024&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-design-a-network-storage-solution-for-family-photos/images/Screenshot_20230418_144114-461x1024_hu321e831bec0a4f4bcb933be48e6a7cf9_17242_480x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 480w, https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-design-a-network-storage-solution-for-family-photos/images/Screenshot_20230418_144114-461x1024_hu321e831bec0a4f4bcb933be48e6a7cf9_17242_1024x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp 1024w&#34;
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;45&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;108px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Better privacy. Compared with other cloud storage in China, Onedrive does a good job in privacy protection. Other cloud stores use SHA1 collision by default when uploading files, so if the file is available in the cloud server, it will bypass the upload step and copy the file directly to the user&amp;rsquo;s folder. ps: Nowadays, this has become a major disadvantage of Onedrive, because users need to upload all files through their own network. For example, uploading a movie file downloaded on the Internet will most likely take only a few seconds on other web sites (most of the Internet resources are backed up in these cloud stores), but Onedrive requires the complete re-upload of the file over the user&amp;rsquo;s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Easy to connect with Windows systems and Offce software. For example, in windows 11, onedrive is the only backup method in the system settings by default. If you need to backup to local hard disk, you need to find the traditional &amp;ldquo;control panel&amp;rdquo; and choose windows 7 backup mode to backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onedrive gives you the option to add all your photos from your personal folder to an album, even if they are not placed in the default photo folder, so you can manage them easily. In addition, onedrive also provides intelligent classification recognition of pictures and text ocr search of pictures.Overall, Onedrive is a moderate cloud storage service. However, since it does not provide localized personal services in mainland China, there are many inconveniences in the process of using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The speed of internet connection is not high. I subscribed to MicroSoft 365 family service, and I can open up to 6 accounts with 6TB storage space, but in the process of using it, I often encounter network blockage, the speed is fast and slow, and occasionally disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. onedrive does not support Chinese well. There have been problems with onedrive in Chinese search. For example, document search does not support Chinese. In the latest version of the app, onedrive still doesn&amp;rsquo;t support Chinese well in photo search, and only the first 50 search results are displayed each time, which is obviously not enough for me who has more than 100,000 photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Some services of Onedrive are blocked in China. For example, there is usually no way to open the photo sharing links directly, you have to borrow VPN and other ways to access them. The web version of onedrive is also blocked in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-huawei-cloud-drive&#34;&gt;4. Huawei Cloud Drive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei&amp;rsquo;s cloud storage solution is similar to iCloud in that it offers 5GB of space for free and 50GB/200GB/2024GB for a fee. The main advantages are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Deeply bound to the cell phone system. You can experience the convenience of cloud services in the album without perception, and because Chinese cell phone manufacturers continue to innovate in the album, the addition of various artificial intelligence recognition services makes it extremely convenient to find photos in the phone. Even if the number of photos I had stored in Huawei&amp;rsquo;s cloud reached hundred of thousands, I was able to quickly filter them out through the search function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. The overall speed of use is smooth. On the one hand, I rarely encounter the situation that I can&amp;rsquo;t open photos because of network problems, and the upload and download speeds are kept at excellent levels. On the other hand, in terms of photo album integration, the photos stored in the cloud are basically the same as local photos, so users don&amp;rsquo;t need to care whether the photos are stored locally or in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Comes with cell phone system backup function. If you turn on a high-capacity cloud package service, you can generally backup your phone files to the cloud as a whole, and you only need to log in to your original account when you change your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the cloud storage of cell phone manufacturers mainly focus on cell phone use, the scope of use is narrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Cross-platform use is difficult. Unless the whole family uses the same brand of cell phones and computers, it is difficult to share the cloud storage space and its convenience with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. The price is high. For example, Huawei&amp;rsquo;s 2048gb package plan costs RMB 68 per month, more than three times the price of other mainstream consumer cloud storage space on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Huawei cloud storage is in the same class as Apple&amp;rsquo;s iCloud. But because Huawei was sanctioned by the United States, his hardware line is currently less complete and better than Apple&amp;rsquo;s, which is indeed a great pity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-aliyundrive&#34;&gt;5. AliyunDrive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AliyunDrive is a new service launched by Alibaba Group in the last two years, with free and unlimited speed as its main selling point, which relies on Aliyun platform, currently the largest cloud service platform in China. This website is also hosted on AliCloud Singapore server. Because the back of the tree is good to ride, so Ali cloud disk currently also has a great advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. First is its main selling point of unlimited speed as well as free. Currently Ali cloud for free users to provide more than 2TB of cloud disk capacity, and able to through the daily sign-up function and participate in other free activities, regularly receive premium membership services. However, AliCloud&amp;rsquo;s promise of unlimited speed is mainly a huge improvement compared to other consumer network drive services in China, but not completely unlimited speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. AliCloud Drive&amp;rsquo;s user interface is relatively simple and convenient, similar to One drive, and is very user-friendly compared to other consumer network drives in China, without too many ads and other cluttered content displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. The photo management function of AliCloud Drive is relatively powerful, and it can use AI intelligence to identify and sort most photos. In addition, in addition to personal file storage, Ali Cloud Drive also has a very large number of network resources to share, so you can easily access to a variety of file resources on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because Ali Cloud Drive is generally a latecomer to the role, there are some problems in daily use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The stability of AliCloud Disk App is not high enough, there are some lagging and bug problems. For example, when I used my computer to upload 200GB photos to Ali Cloud Drive, the software freezes occurred many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. AliCloud&amp;rsquo;s photo album function has a completely different storage logic than other web drives. By default, AliCloud will put all the photos and videos uploaded by users into its photo module, and users cannot manage their own photo folders. And after users create new albums under its photo module by themselves, they can only operate 500 photos at a time, and even for photo deletion operation, they can only delete 2000 photos at a time, which is obviously not enough for a large number of photo management needs in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Ali cloud disk privacy protection and Baidu cloud disk as a difficult to say, especially Ali cloud disk itself is focused on free services, is bound to sacrifice a certain amount of user data privacy to meet aliyun computing services for certain purposes. For example, aliyun disk will intelligently identify each photo and video uploaded by users, review its legality, and even immediately displayed a warning is issued within seconds of the user uploading the video that one of the images in the video file has a violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. At present, Ali Cloud Drive has already passed the initial promotion period, and as the user base continues to expand, the online fee model and other usage restrictions may increasingly become the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-baidu-cloud-drive&#34;&gt;6. Baidu Cloud Drive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu Cloud Drive was a network storage that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to mention here at all because there were too many bad experiences. But overall, Baidu Cloud Drive is still the most used network drive service in China. The main advantages are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Baidu Cloud Drive was developed earlier and has a huge user base base and a first mover advantage. It is the most complete network resource on the entire Chinese Internet. But this is actually not too attractive for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Baidu Cloud Drive provides 2TB of storage space for free users, which is enough for the vast majority of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Baidu Cloud Drive, combined with Baidu Search and Baidu Library, is the preferred file sharing method for most Chinese web users. If one is going to share a large number of files with others, using Baidu Cloud Drive, the other party is generally acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Baidu Cloud Drive has a spotty history of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Baidu Cloud Drive is probably one of the most restrictive network drives in the world for free users. Free registered users of Baidu Cloud Drive can usually only reach 20KB/s when downloading files, which is not at all like something a modern network service company can do. It has now improved under the verbal criticism of the general media, but it is still not friendly enough for free users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Baidu Cloud Drive monitors and deletes user files. As long as a file is intelligently identified by Baidu Cloud Drive as illegal or potentially risky, Baidu Cloud Drive will delete the file without informing the user. Since this intelligent identification is done automatically by the machine and does not give any hint to the user, it is easy to give the user the risk of losing the file. In case the file is deleted by mistake, there is basically no possibility for the user to get the file back.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above mentioned is the case of the free version of Baidu Cloud Drive, if you buy Baidu Cloud Drive paid services, the experience will feel much better, except for automatic deletion of user files and privacy issues, the other is first-class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-chinamobile-cloud-drive&#34;&gt;7. ChinaMobile Cloud Drive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the three major mobile operators in China, all offer their own network cloud storage services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the quality of cloud storage services operated by these three companies are similar. The main advantage is that mobile operators&amp;rsquo; network cloud drives usually exempt users from charging for cell phone traffic when using the cloud drive, and users are able to store and download services smoothly when using the operators&amp;rsquo; mobile communication networks and home fiber broadband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all three carriers&amp;rsquo; network drives have the same problem; all three of their offerings are technically inferior to other network drive services. For example, China Mobile Cloud Drive&amp;rsquo;s folders can only copy and move up to a few thousand files at a time, which is extremely inconvenient for users like me who have a huge number of files. In addition, China Mobile Cloud Drive&amp;rsquo;s intelligent photo recognition function can only identify up to 20 kinds of categories, which is a huge gap compared to cell phone manufacturers and other consumer network cloud drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if it is used as a file backup tool, I personally think it is still very suitable, because China&amp;rsquo;s mobile operators are state-owned enterprises, they can hardly take users&amp;rsquo; private data to meet other commercial purposes like other private companies, and these giant state-owned enterprises are at a very high level in the Chinese government agencies, so it is difficult for ordinary regulators to access these files, and the privacy for users is still better than other Internet companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-wps-cloud-drive&#34;&gt;8. WPS Cloud Drive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WPS Cloud Drive is similar to onedrive, but its functionality is completely limited to WPS office files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried to use WPS Cloud Drive to store some of my personal photos, but there is no way to manage them other than folders. And its search function is developed based on document logic, there is almost no possibility to search for photos unless you can remember the file name of the photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Chinese network environment, WPS cloud drive is the best way to store office files, he provides a complete text and OCR search function, and WPS office itself for the vast majority of non-professional users, has enough to compete with Microsoft office, the price is also much cheaper than Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it can be expected that, as microsoft office has begun to introduce chatgpt function, and WPS office&amp;rsquo;s artificial intelligence module is still in the process of development, wps in this regard relative to Microsoft still exists a large gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My personal scoring of the above storage products and services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-design-a-network-storage-solution-for-family-photos/images/table-1024x677.webp&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This table is based entirely on individual usage and is intended to be used only as a reference for its analysis. For example, in terms of subsequent usage costs, since I have already purchased part of the cloud storage service for a long period of time, I do not need to pay additional fees for some time in the future. In addition, Synology NAS requires expenses for electricity, and my DS416slim consumes about 100 kWh of electricity per year, which is about 70 RMB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-final-choice-of-solution&#34;&gt;My final choice of solution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After analyzing the various storage products and services in use, I personally tend to make the following arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Continue to use Synology NAS as the main home storage device and use the photo function with limited external network transfer speed. I will purchase a new NAS product to replace it at an appropriate time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Give up using 115 Cloud, in fact I haven&amp;rsquo;t used the service for a few months and will not renew it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Discontinue the use of Huawei Cloud storage service until the whole family has updated their phones to Huawei phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. Continue to use Onedrive as a backup option for family files and use its photo feature less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e. Abandon the use of Aliyun Cloud and Baidu Cloud. In such services where network file sharing is the main application scenario, it is okay to download network resources occasionally, but storing important family and personal files is too worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f. Continue to use China Mobile Cloud as a backup for family files and use its photo function appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;g. Continue to use WPS Cloud as the primary management method for Office documents until 2029, and then see what happens later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope my selection process will help you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/dispute-over-time-nodes-in-property-service-contract-cases/images/1665824_a36a30d9.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Dispute over Time Nodes in Property Service Contract Cases" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a typical case of property service contract dispute, where the plaintiff is Branch A of a property management company in Shanghai, and the defendants are owners Cao and Guo of a residential community, with the case being a dispute over the property service contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-facts-of-the-case&#34;&gt;Basic Facts of the Case 
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owners Cao and Guo purchased Unit 1302 in a residential community in Foshan City, and accordingly, they signed a “Commercial Property Purchase Contract (Presale)” with the developer and a “Preliminary Property Service Agreement for Foshan City” with Company A, stipulating the terms of property management (abridged): Implementing a bundled fee system for property services (including common area utility costs), with property service fees collected based on a first-tier service standard, paid monthly by the owners according to the area of the property they own, with the payment due on the 5th of each month. The charge for high-rise residential buildings is 2.4 yuan/square meter/month; the parking space charge is 2.4 yuan/square meter/month. If an owner fails to pay the property management service fee as required, they should be urged to make the payment within a limited period, and if they still do not pay after the deadline, the owners’ committee or the property service company may publish the collection status of property service fees within the property management area, naming the owners who owe fees and their building and unit numbers for collection; if payment is still not made, legal action may be taken in the people’s court. Article 11 of the “Commercial Property Purchase Contract (Presale)” stipulates the handover date as June 30, 2021. The building involved in this case was completed and registered for acceptance on December 31, 2020. Cao and Guo received the acceptance notice and went to inspect the property on July 2, 2021, but did not complete the acceptance procedures; they later accepted the property on June 8, 2022. The property involved in the case had already been registered for real estate on April 20, 2022. Company A believes that Cao and Guo owe property service fees amounting to 3,039.37 yuan from June 30, 2021, to August 31, 2022, and filed a lawsuit after issuing a demand notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disposition-of-the-case&#34;&gt;Disposition of the Case
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court ruled that owners Cao and Guo shall, within ten days of the effective date of the judgment, pay property service fees amounting to 3,039.37 yuan to the plaintiff Company A; other claims of the plaintiff were rejected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-insights&#34;&gt;Case Insights
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “two-faced” phenomenon is prevalent in the provision of services by property management companies. When entering into a property service agreement, the property management company promises a higher level of service to the owners (construction units) or the owners’ committee and agrees on the corresponding level of service charge standards. However, the actual property services provided cannot match the level of the charges, with a significant disconnect, which is referred to by owners as “high charges and low services.” In litigation, no evidence of service levels is provided, and the contract does not stipulate or stipulates a too high penalty for breach of contract, which is clearly insufficient to justify the request for the penalty from the people’s court. Low service levels also indicate that the property management company itself is in breach of contract. In cases of mutual breach, the court only supports the basic property management fees, which is more fair and reasonable. Therefore, property management companies should take this case as a lesson to reflect on themselves, strive to improve their own service levels, and then fulfill their burden of proof to reduce unpaid fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For owners, they should also clarify the parties to the contract and the responsible parties. Owners should not conflate the responsibilities of the developers and the property management companies. If the owner acknowledges receiving the acceptance notice and has inspected the property, but did not find any defects involving the main structure or safety quality issues, the property meets the agreed delivery standards, and the delivery notice is binding on the owner. If the owner finds defects that require general repairs or the gas pipelines are not yet opened upon receiving the property, the contract only stipulates the developer’s obligations for repairs and remedies, and does not grant the owner the right to refuse to accept the property, nor can it be used as a reason to refuse to pay property management fees. Owners must clearly understand the rights and obligations. Because the repair of the exclusive portion is a contractual dispute between them and the developer, and has nothing to do with the property management company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of pre-sale property disputes arising during the transaction of new residential properties is a common civil dispute. In such cases, due to the different responsibility and obligation relationships between the owners, property management companies, and developers, as well as the different legal effects arising from the time nodes such as the signing of the pre-sale contract, inspection and acceptance of the property, and real estate registration, owners often find it difficult to accurately define the boundaries of their own rights and obligations, and it is also easy for property management companies to have the “high charges and low services” phenomenon. This case has certain typical significance for promoting the standardized services of property management companies and for owners to perform their legal obligations and standardize their rights protection behaviors according to the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my junior high school alma mater, and I spent 3 happy years here from 2000 to 2003. The building was built before 1980, when it was built on top of a remote hill because arable land could not be occupied. At that time, the building standards were not high and the quality was not very good, but as a rural middle school, it was not easy to do this. Unfortunately, with the urbanization of China, this school was abandoned after 2005 and a new school was built in the center of our town.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/as-an-ordinary-chinese-how-to-view-the-russian-ukrainian-war/images/russiab-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post As an ordinary Chinese, how to view the Russian-Ukrainian war" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-nature-of-the-russia-ukraine-war&#34;&gt;What is the nature of the Russia-Ukraine war?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the causes of the Russia-Ukraine war, there have been very detailed analyzes on the Internet. Some have been counted since the Crimean War in 2014, some have been counted since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, some have been counted since Lenin established Ukraine, and some even date back to the era of Tsarist Russia and even Kievan Rus. But just looking at this Russia-Ukraine war, the direct reason is that Ukraine wants to join NATO, unilaterally change the security status quo of Russia and Ukraine, and wants to use the power of NATO to fully confront Russia. NATO, headed by the United States, regards Ukraine as a pawn and continues to provoke Russia in terms of security, putting unprecedented pressure on Russia&amp;rsquo;s security situation. Referring to Maslow&amp;rsquo;s need principle, security and survival are the most fundamental and bottom-line needs of a country. If they pose a huge threat to a country&amp;rsquo;s security, they will inevitably lead to fierce resistance, and this war is exactly the result that NATO, led by the United States, would like to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the theory of justifiable self-defense in the Criminal Law, it is &amp;ldquo;instigation to defend&amp;rdquo; (Instigation of Defense) to intentionally irritate the other party and induce the other party to infringe oneself by using improper means such as provocation and provocation, and then use &amp;ldquo;justifiable self-defense&amp;rdquo; as an excuse to carry out the harm. of Defense), which is an illegal act and is not protected by law. NATO, headed by the United States, essentially adopted a defensive method in the Russia-Ukraine war, deliberately angering Russia, luring Russia to invade Ukraine, and then using &amp;ldquo;launching war&amp;rdquo; as an excuse to impose comprehensive sanctions on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/as-an-ordinary-chinese-how-to-view-the-russian-ukrainian-war/images/russiab-1024x684.webp&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;as-chinese-citizens-what-attitude-should-we-take-towards-the-russia-ukraine-war&#34;&gt;As Chinese citizens, what attitude should we take towards the Russia-Ukraine War?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;     Russia and China are a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination, which I believe most people have heard of. But Ukraine also has a profound friendship with China. Ukraine is China’s first strategic partner in Central and Eastern Europe, and it is also the third country to establish a strategic partnership with China after Russia and Kazakhstan in the post-Soviet era. Regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, China, as a friend of both sides, is extremely unwilling to see it, but since the war has already happened, as Chinese citizens, we should also correctly view the war from the perspective of national interests, and not casually stand in line. It mainly includes 3 aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must respect the integrity of a country&amp;rsquo;s territory and sovereignty, and do not support unilateral changes to another country&amp;rsquo;s sovereignty and territory from the outside, that is, we do not support Russia&amp;rsquo;s occupation of the Donbas region by means of war and its inclusion in its own territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is necessary to respect the settlement of international disputes through peaceful means and not to support the settlement of international disputes through war, that is, to support the two sides to resolve current issues through negotiation instead of continuing to expand the scale of war or even linking external forces to join the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must resolutely oppose wars that are against humanity and inhumane means, that is, the warring parties must not resort to attacking civilians, genocide, or using weapons of mass destruction to achieve their war goals. Both warring parties should try their best to protect Chinese nationals from the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/the-character-garbled-problem-encountered-by-lexus-playing-cd/images/IMG_20230415_152142-scaled-e1681543616554-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post The character garbled problem encountered by Lexus playing CD" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently encountered a tricky problem when burning a CD. On the Lexus car CD player, the Chinese music label cannot be read. Looking back now, this problem may be unsolvable at the moment. Here is just a record of the solution process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/the-character-garbled-problem-encountered-by-lexus-playing-cd/images/IMG_20230415_150947-1024x584.webp&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;burning-program-selection&#34;&gt;Burning program selection.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before choosing to burn a CD, I searched for various burning tutorials in detail. The main difference is the choice of burning software. I have chosen Nero, Brunatonce and ImgBurn successively. Of the three, the first is old-fashioned paid software, and the second and third are free software. But Brunatonce has not been updated for more than ten years because of the developer, and the latest version stays at 0.99.5 in 2004. Although it can be used in XP compatibility mode on Windows 11, it still encounters inexplicable errors. In addition, it is said that among the three, Brunatonce is the software with the best low-speed recording effect, but since the current CD recorder has no low-speed recording, the starting point is above 10x, so it is of little significance. It is mainly recommended to use ImgBurn here. Although the program has not been updated for a long time, the developers have been answering questions online at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://forum.imgburn.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;http://forum.imgburn.com&lt;/a&gt;. Any questions can be answered in a short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;choose-the-recording-method&#34;&gt;Choose the recording method.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, the existing audio assets and the burning goals that need to be achieved. There are three main ways of distinguishing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a. Choice of audio CD and music CD&lt;/strong&gt;. Among them, audio CD refers to the lossless analog audio format *.cda reversed through the WAV format, which is non-digital music, and all CD records purchased by default are in this format. Music CD is a digital music format, and generally supports compressed music formats such as mp3/wma/aac. As far as 2022 is concerned, burning CDs generally pursues the former, and the effect of the latter will not be much better than listening to music via Bluetooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b. Selection of audio CD resources&lt;/strong&gt;. There are generally three music formats that can be burned as audio CDs: WAV, FLAC, and APE. And the music file of the same format has the difference of full track and split track, that is, a single CD is a whole file of about 400-700MB, or more than 10 single files of about 30-50MB. If it is downloaded from Ziyuan.com, most of the files are whole tracks, but on platforms such as QQ Music, only single tracks can be downloaded, and the entire CD cannot be downloaded as a file. It is generally recommended to choose the whole track file to burn. On the one hand, there is no need to worry about the insufficient capacity of the CD. On the other hand, the whole track file usually comes with a CUE file, or the format of ape can also be directly extracted from the CUE file through foobar2000. When burning a combination of self-selected songs, the main thing to be calculated is the CD capacity, which generally should not exceed 750MB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c. Audio CD-TEXT production&lt;/strong&gt;. As mentioned above, audio CD is an analog music format launched in 1982. At that time, CDs were the same as song tapes, and it was impossible to record song information. However, in 1995, Sony and Philips launched the CD-TEXT standard, which can embed CD-related track information at the beginning of the CD file. After that, Jeff Arnold developed the CUE Sheet file on the basis of CD-TEXT in 1997, and it has been followed by almost all Mainstream player support. Of course, this is the problem, whether it is the CD-TEXT standard_.cdt file, or follow-up_.cue files, in the Windows 95 era in the 1990s, almost never considered supporting Chinese natively. The former *.cdt file only supports ASCII (English letters), 8859 (English and European letters), MS-JIS (some Japanese characters) three character encodings, while the latter CUE only supports ANSI character encodings. Among them, the ANSI encoding is the most pitted. This encoding is automatically recognized as ASCII in North America, automatically converted to GB2312 in mainland China, and automatically converted to Shfit-JIS in Japan. That is, if an ANSI-encoded CUE file is made on a Windows computer set to the Chinese environment, it will be garbled when opened on a Windows computer under the English environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The biggest problem I encountered this time is that the Lexus CD player does not support the GB2312 mode ANSI in mainland China, so if the current cue file recording method is used, it will inevitably be garbled when encountering Chinese. Unless the cdt file editing mode is adopted, there are almost no ready-made cdt file editors on the Internet. Even though NERO can write cd-text files, it still uses the *.nra files developed by NERO to convert, and the actual test has no effect . The only way I can find out is to use Sony’s official cdt editor released in 1995 to edit, but if you want to insert Chinese, you can only edit in Windows 95 in the MS-JIS Japanese environment, with the help of 2500 A Chinese character commonly used in Japanese is realized. This method is a bit too frustrating. When I was discussing with the developer of ImgBrun, he also suggested that I should give up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;burning-process-ideas&#34;&gt;Burning process ideas.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I found garbled characters in the first recording, I searched all the information about CUE files in the Chinese circle, and came to three conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a. CUE must use ANSI format;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b. ANSI codes are different in different regions (as above &amp;ldquo;2.&amp;rdquo;);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;c. When the burned CD is played on the computer, unless a special plug-in is used, the effect of Chinese CD-TEXT cannot be seen generally. For example, in Foobar2000, it is displayed as garbled characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When burning for the second time, I chose to install a hyper-v virtual machine to test the cue file encoding problem in the English Windows 11 environment, and found three problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a. Chinese ANSI-encoded files are displayed as garbled characters in the English environment (as above &amp;ldquo;2.&amp;rdquo;);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b. The UTF-8 encoding opened in Notepad on Windows 11 is not the same as the UTF-8 encoding opened in Windows XP Notepad. UTF-8 in XP corresponds to UTF-16 LE in Windows 11. It is more obvious in ImgBurn, only the cue file converted to UTF-16LE can be loaded normally in ImgBurn in English environment, otherwise it will be displayed as garbled characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;c. Although the CUE file encoded with UTF-16 LE can be recognized by ImgBurn, it is impossible to successfully engrave the CUE file with this encoding, because the CUE file itself only supports ANSI encoding, even if you choose to recognize UTF-16 in ImgBurn After LE encodes the file to force the output of ANSI, it is also displayed as garbled characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDs are a thing of the past. Nowadays, whether it is U disk, mobile phone Bluetooth or CarPlay, HiCar, CarLife and other connection modes, they are many times more convenient and easier to use than CDs. As a technology that can be called outdated, it is very difficult to seek technical support now. What is rare is that in the process of solving the problem, I still encountered a lot of useful information on the Internet. For example, I searched on Japanese websites and found hundreds of pages of discussions on how CD-TEXT supports Japanese in 2002. I saw developer 20 on ImgBurn. Year after year, I have been silently giving support to niche users. On the official websites of GNU and SONY, the links to technical documents from nearly 30 years ago are still well preserved. In comparison, it is really difficult to search for useful information on the Chinese Internet. Not to mention whether the links on the web pages 20 years ago can be opened normally, the normal search information is not right. No reason was found. For example, in many Chinese technical documents about CUE, it is shown that CD-text files support 8 languages, but which 8 languages are supported specifically, whether they contain Chinese codes, there is no place to find information, and the source of this statement is found through English searches. It is a technical manuscript on GNU, which is basically copied from the original text, but the technical manuscript on GNU gives an accurate source of evidence, that is, the official document on SONY DADC, from which it is found that the so-called 8 languages, except Japanese, other All are English, German, French and other European languages, excluding Chinese. Just stopped thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why 1000M fiber broadband, sometimes the speed is only 300M</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/why-1000m-fiber-broadband-sometimes-the-speed-is-only-300m/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/why-1000m-fiber-broadband-sometimes-the-speed-is-only-300m/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/why-1000m-fiber-broadband-sometimes-the-speed-is-only-300m/images/2023-04-15-155723-1.png" alt="Featured image of post Why 1000M fiber broadband, sometimes the speed is only 300M" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this question mainly because I searched all kinds of information on Baidu, and it was basically the same content. There were few articles that clarified this question. Most of them were nonsense. Sarcasm and personal attacks have no idea of solving the problem. Since I just encountered this problem, I will write a solution here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-why-is-the-speed-of-1000m-fiber-optic-broadband-only-300m&#34;&gt;1. Why is the speed of 1000M fiber optic broadband only 300M?**
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possible reasons: WAN TO LAN rate limit of the router; hardware acceleration is not enabled on the router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirmation of prerequisites: The network has been upgraded to 1000M optical fiber, the optical modem supports Gigabit output, and the router WAN and LAN ports both support 1000M Gigabit speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://Smallnetbuilder.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;http://Smallnetbuilder.com&lt;/a&gt;Query the router WAN TO LAN rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netgear r7000 WAN TO LAN rate: 931Mbps&lt;br&gt;
Netgear r6300v2 WAN TO LAN rate: 806Mbps&lt;br&gt;
ASUS ac68u WAN TO LAN rate: 754.5Mbps&lt;br&gt;
TP TP-LINK TGR1900 WAN TO LAN rate: 631Mbps&lt;br&gt;
Netgear r6100 WAN TO LAN rate: 93.1Mbps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other no-name routers may have insufficient hardware capabilities, and the WAN to LAN rate itself is low. It is not surprising that the wan port accesses 1000M and the LAN port outputs 300M.`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether to enable NAT hardware acceleration in the router settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the actual measurement, when the R6300V2 does not enable NAT hardware acceleration, the WAN port can only input 1000M, and the LAN port can only output 300M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the NAT hardware acceleration is turned on, the WAN port can input 1000M, and the LAN port can output 800M.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-why-is-the-speed-measurement-only-800m-or-920m-for-1000m-fiber-optic-broadband&#34;&gt;2. Why is the speed measurement only 800M or 920M for 1000M fiber optic broadband?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, on nga someone asked &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ngabbs.com/read.php?tid=24003618&amp;amp;rand=981&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Telecom gigabit broadband speed measurement is only 800~900M&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;Many answers below basically miss the point. The core problem is that the maximum WAN to LAN rate of mainstream 1000M wifi6 routers is only about 920Mbps. You can check the relevant test results on the above website.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/a-more-economical-bluetooth-solution-for-everyday-use/images/2-4-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post A more economical Bluetooth solution for everyday use" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With iPhone and Android canceling the 3.5mm audio interface one after another, Bluetooth devices ushered in a new round of explosion. Recently, I am playing Tencent’s new PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds: Stimulating the Battlefield. The foundation of years of fps is still there, and I can get started very quickly. Both 80% can enter the top 10. But this game has a very unfriendly problem - extremely fast power consumption, iPhone 7P 100% power, only open the default effect, the average power consumption per 20 minutes is about 20%-25%, full power is enough to play for more than 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most basic requirement of FPS games is - headphones. But the current iPhone can no longer charge while playing games after using wired headsets, forcing users to upgrade to Bluetooth headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluetooth headsets are not just needed. Although airpods are good, the price/performance ratio is too low for my needs. Sports Bluetooth headsets already have sony sbh70, and there is also a rambler that has been in the dust for a long time, but after trying it, it is necessary to play FPS. For games with a strong sense of positioning, there is still a big gap between earplugs and fully-wrapped headphones. It just so happens that I have a SHP9500 that has been in the dust for a long time. Back then, it was known as the king of cost-effective earphones under 1,000 yuan, so I wanted to use it as a chicken earphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started looking for a bluetooth receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, when I was playing with monitor speakers, I paid attention to the field of Bluetooth receivers. At that time, I used i-audio’s Z2 as the sound source. I can’t remember the brand’s power amplifier and M-audio’s bx5a speakers to play. It just so happens that the player also has Bluetooth. , and it is said that it also supports the popular aptX protocol at that time, so I bought a Tianyi BTS-1 Bluetooth receiver online. However, it was later confirmed that the receiver was suspected of false advertising. After detailed packet capture tests, the receiver did not actually support aptX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/a-more-economical-bluetooth-solution-for-everyday-use/images/09_COWON_1-jpg.webp&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;339px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of development, aptX has fallen from the altar, and the original CSR company has long been acquired by Qualcomm. It is estimated that most of the new Qualcomm chips can support aptX. However, aptX still maintains the original tradition, listing all authorized manufacturers and products on the aptx.com website in detail. After some searching, I found that Lulian, a domestic civilian brand, has many products listed, so I placed an order decisively.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose the two most compact ones - CM150 and CM124, a transmitter and a receiver, for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the receiver is used on the front SHP9500 to transform the wired headset into a Bluetooth headset, while the transmitter is used on the Yamaha SLG200s, which can be easily connected to several Bluetooth speakers and headsets at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in fact, aptX is useless for the iPhone, because the iPhone only supports AAC and SBC, but the receiver + transmitter both support aptX, so you can easily connect the Yamaha SLG200s wirelessly. After all, aptX is already the pinnacle of Bluetooth. The default support order of these two receivers and transmitters of Greenlink is also aptX, AAC and SBC, so there is no need to worry about transmission standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in actual use, I still found a little problem, like the guitar, which uses Bluetooth to transmit the signal, and occasionally there will still be a little stuck, just like the Razer Fortress Spider that was upgraded in order to play games with the HTPC small steel cannon in the living room. Even with a touching price, it does not bring a smooth experience, and some sacrifices have to be made between portability and usability.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rule of law and institutions</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/rule-of-law-and-institutions/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/rule-of-law-and-institutions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/rule-of-law-and-institutions/images/146362_ec6ba4c5fe453330bdafc1bc881690ef-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post Rule of law and institutions" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having nothing to do today, I found a copy of the political gains and losses in China written by Qian Mu from the bookshelf. The content of the book was written in the 1950s. The usage of some historical terms is slightly different from that in contemporary China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to be regarded as feudalism, but in the modern division, the Qin Dynasty is the beginning of feudalism. For example, in the book, in order to solve the contradiction between private land ownership and taxation, the Han Dynasty mentioned that Dong Zhongshu restricted the large-scale concentration of land, and Wang Mang Then the method of equalizing the fields was directly used, which resulted in failure. Wang Mang&amp;rsquo;s land equalization was not the only one in history. The Revolution of 1911 also proposed the establishment of the Republic of China and the equalization of land rights. Of course, he did not actually do it. In the end, this great problem of thousands of years was completely realized in the Deng Xiaoping era, and the corresponding poll tax and agricultural tax were also completely ended in the Wen Jiabao era. This may also be after the founding of New China. The biggest change to our basic institutions in 2,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We summarize the above-mentioned economic policies of the Han Dynasty. For industry and commerce, it is close to advocating the so-called restraint of capital. In terms of land rent for farmers, it has also achieved light labor and light taxes, but it has not equalized land rights. . During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Dong Zhongshu once advocated the policy of restricting land. Even if the acres of land in the country cannot be distributed equally, there must be a maximum limit so that each landlord cannot exceed the limit of a thousand acres. Unfortunately, even this policy has not been implemented. So when Wang Mang got up, he aroused a major reform, and all the land was nationalized, called Huangtian, and redistributed. The idea at the time was to restore the well field system of the feudal era, but the result was a major disturbance. Wang Mang failed, and there has been no thorough reform of the land system in Chinese history since then. ‬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is divided into five parts: Han, Tang, Song, Ming and Qing. Due to time constraints, I only read the first part of the Han Dynasty. For the rest of the time, I watched a recent eight-episode documentary called Qiangjun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast. China&amp;rsquo;s political system for more than 2,000 years has actually been finalized very early, including many of our current systems, which were already applicable before the Qin and Han Dynasties. The biggest problem is that after the New Culture Movement and the dilapidation of the Cultural Revolution, contemporary education has an overly negative evaluation of the imperial dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political system of China&amp;rsquo;s past dynasties cannot be separated from two core issues, one is the relationship between the first and second leaders, and the other is the relationship between the central government and the local government. For example, in the Han Dynasty, the first leader was the emperor, and the second leader was the prime minister. The power of the emperor is mainly embodied by the six books in charge of food and daily life, while the power of the prime minister is embodied in various government agencies. In fact, it is very close to the state form of modern constitutional monarchy. There is a strict distinction between imperial power and government. The problem is that. This good institutional model is only continued through customary law, and has not risen to the framework of statutory law, resulting in very different effects in different emperors&amp;rsquo; reigns. Some emperors have outstanding abilities and must do everything by themselves, so the prime minister has no room to use his skills. The imperial power and the government have become one, and they have become the de facto home world. Some emperors are willing to inherit the ancient system, the imperial power and regime are highly differentiated, and professional bureaucrats can exert their maximum effectiveness. This is also a reference for observing the political situation in the past 20 years. And such a system that the main local bureaucrats cannot be held by local people was unexpectedly established in the Han Dynasty, and the original intention was to prevent problems caused by excessive local power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary talks about the reform of the military in recent years, which is actually a process of destroying the old and establishing the new, and the system must ultimately be implemented by people. Throughout the Chinese dynasties, there has been a mass mentality of respecting the virtuous but not the public. There is no democratic soil. Only a virtuous monarch can lead the people to prosperity. The era of stagnation and retrogression must be due to the emergence of corrupt leaders. This kind of system design is estimated to continue for a long time, and the public will buy it, and they will always think that this is definitely not a problem with the system at the top, but a problem with the implementation at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qian Mu mentioned in the book that it is impossible for any system to be implemented for one or two hundred years without changing, because the people who implement the system are always changing. This point still needs to be further understood. The framework of the rule of law will not be achieved overnight, and self-healing ability is too important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added on October 10th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a deep understanding of history. Except for a certain understanding of Chinese history in middle school history books more than ten years ago, I have basically never touched it in the rest of the time. When I saw this book, I saw it by chance in a bookstore and thought it was quite thin, so I bought it. It has been placed on the bookshelf for several years, and just in time for the National Day holiday, I pulled it out and looked through it when I had time. I have also bought some other history books, almost all of which are more than hundreds of thousands of words, and I have never read them. After reading this book, there are three main impressions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answers to many years of doubts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book explains very thoroughly the relationship between imperial power and the government in Chinese history. It can be said that after so many years of socialist history education, I have always mistakenly believed that the emperor is arbitrary and has the final say. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that there would be a practice similar to the constitutional monarchy in the Han Dynasty, and the imperial power would have so many constraints. Secondly, the book explains very clearly the origin, development and reform of many political, military, household registration and taxation systems. I have a more systematic understanding of Chinese history, and my impression of imperial dynasties has also changed a lot. I am even more amazed The ancients were able to design such a sophisticated political system more than 2,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new understanding of the relationship between personnel and systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my work, I often talk about the need to set up various systems to make the work more standardized, let the system restrain people, and hope that the system can solve the problem once and for all. However, in practice, there are indeed huge contrasts when different personnel operate the same system. This book lists many examples of system failure caused by changes in the times and personnel changes, highlighting the core issue of system self-healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strict distinction should be made between opinions on history and opinions on the times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we evaluate many historical events and characters, we often involuntarily apply the contemporary social environment and values, and always hope to judge from the perspective of God or from a position that we think is neutral. But in the end, the historical characters or events Whether it is good or bad, we should mainly follow the opinions of the people at that time, and it would be very immoral and meaningless to evaluate it out of that environment.&lt;/p&gt;

The Xijiang River is the fourth longest river in China (the first three are the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Heilongjiang River), the second in shipping (second only to the Yangtze River), and the second in overall water flow (the main stream of the Pearl River, which is the third separately)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first time I ran a long distance, and I brought back dozens of bottles of wine and hundreds of catties of vegetables. More than 1,500 kilometers back and forth, a total of 16 or 17 hours of driving, the spirit was highly concentrated, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t squint my eyes when entering the service area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only regret is that the tire was scratched on the rural concrete road at night, and hundreds of dollars were pitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the training at the Party School of the Municipal Party Committee, part of the course is arranged for outdoor learning, mainly to visit and learn the working mode and construction experience of the Sino-German Industrial Service Zone and the Financial High-tech Zone. I feel that Foshan has finally paid attention to urban construction in the past few years, otherwise the appearance of the city really does not match its economic status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stream at the foot of the mountain is turbulent, and the steep slopes stand continuously on the mountain. Although the number 6666 may not be true, the overall slope and difficulty are still worthy of the title of No. 1 in Foshan, although this title does not have much gold content. .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chinese version of xbox one seems to be no longer region-locked. After unlocking the game disc in the second half of last year, all other regional version discs can be supported, and after unlocking the Chinese display of the traditional Chinese disc, I tried Halo 5 tonight. The foreign server is directly online, and the online speed is extremely fast. It takes half a minute for a 10-player competitive game, and even for an 18-player war zone game, it only takes about two minutes. It really feels like the sun is coming out of the west. I hope that Microsoft can continue to maintain it, and try titan fall when I have time in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air ticket from Guangzhou to Haikou is 50% cheaper than that to Sanya on average, while the bullet train from Haikou to Sanya only costs 80 yuan and takes two hours. For us working class, it is a little bit to save a little, and there is no doubt that we will transfer from Haikou. I didn’t do my homework at first, thinking that Haikou Airport had to take a taxi to Haikou Railway Station to take a train. When I arrived at the airport, I realized that the train station was in the airport. As the top ten airports in the country, Haikou competed with Sanya for business. One feature is that the structure of this train station is completely a subway station model, not only the lines are underground, but also the platform screen door is also the design method of the subway station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jiuyuan Airlines, as the name suggests, is named after the nine yuan Renminbi ticket as a gimmick. After Xiangpeng, it is the second time to take a low-cost airline flight. However, the various restrictions of 9 yuan are more stringent, and all bags over 40 cm need to be checked in. The boarding pass staff should have been scolded by passengers a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/briefings-of-integrated-law-enforcement-work-in-parts-of-the-country/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/briefings-of-integrated-law-enforcement-work-in-parts-of-the-country/images/R-C-1.png" alt="Featured image of post Briefings on the area of integrated law enforcement work in parts of the country" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, the local government is investigating work reforms in the field of comprehensive law enforcement, but there are still many questions in various aspects. I searched for practices in other places along the way, and briefly formed a brief introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of comprehensive administrative law enforcement reform, local experience is mainly limited to comprehensive law enforcement in areas such as urban management, cultural markets, agricultural resources, and transportation. So far, no experience has been found to unify all or most of the administrative law enforcement powers to establish &amp;ldquo;unified administrative law enforcement.&amp;rdquo; Jiaozhou City, Qingdao is piloting the reform of the comprehensive administrative law enforcement system, but it is currently limited to the exercise of all administrative law enforcement powers at the township level, and no specific practice has been promoted at the county level or above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of implementing a unified platform for accepting and handling administrative law enforcement, currently more mature representative practices include the &amp;ldquo;Fujian Provincial Online Administrative Law Enforcement Platform&amp;rdquo; with a complex difficulty model, the &amp;ldquo;Qiqihar City Administrative Law Enforcement Platform&amp;rdquo; with a simple difficulty model, and the &amp;ldquo;Ningbo City Administrative Law Enforcement Online Platform&amp;rdquo;. Service Hall&amp;quot;, etc. Among them, the experience of Fujian Province is to build a unified electronic network information platform for the whole province. All administrative actions and supervision work are carried out on the platform, including a unified platform for accepting, handling and supervising administrative law enforcement in the whole province; the experience of Qiqihar City is to build a unified The acceptance and information publicity platform does not involve case handling and transfer work; Ningbo City’s experience is to build a unified information publicity platform to publicize the progress and results of all administrative law enforcement actions in the city and accept public supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is an introduction to the specific situation of comprehensive law enforcement in some regions in China:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comprehensive-law-enforcement-work-reform-in-jiaozhou-city&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive law enforcement work reform in Jiaozhou City:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2013, Shandong Province carried out comprehensive administrative law enforcement reform pilots in eight towns (streets) in Jiaozhou City. Under the condition of unchanged organizational structure, the joint law enforcement model was mainly used to promote the integrated comprehensive law enforcement reform of cities, towns (streets) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city has integrated law enforcement functions and implemented centralized law enforcement. At the municipal level, the powers of law enforcement in the eight fields of urban management, land management, environmental protection, production safety, food safety, public security management, cultural management, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, which are scattered in various departments directly under the city, will be concentrated in the proposed comprehensive administrative law enforcement At the township level, integrate the town (street) urban management squadron, safety supervision office, land office and other law enforcement agencies, establish a comprehensive law enforcement squadron, implement a dual management system between the city and the town, focus on town (street) management, and enforce the law by The town (street) is deployed in a unified manner, and the responsibility for law enforcement is assumed by the town (street), and the business is guided by the competent department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrate law enforcement powers at the county and township levels, and set up comprehensive law enforcement departments respectively, so as to advance the concept of comprehensive law enforcement from the township level to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personnel of the comprehensive law enforcement department at the township level are stationed by the law enforcement department at the county level, and their administrative actions need to be reviewed by the law enforcement department at the county level before they become effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;insufficient&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insufficient:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reform has now integrated the law enforcement power at the township level, but it has not yet been substantially advanced at the county level, and has not involved areas such as unified platforms and supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fujian-online-administrative-law-enforcement-platform&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fujian Online Administrative Law Enforcement Platform:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2011, Fujian Province launched the construction of a provincial-level online administrative law enforcement platform. Based on the provincial online administrative examination and approval system and the online examination and approval electronic monitoring system, relying on the existing resources of the provincial government affairs intranet, extranet and digital Fujian, the platform focuses on administrative punishment and takes into account other administrative actions. Based on the principle of practicality and practicality, a provincial-level integrated administrative law enforcement online operation mechanism has been constructed. The platform can realize the online operation and processing of administrative approval and administrative punishment, and accept online electronic supervision. It can meet the needs of the public to inquire about the handling of administrative matters in real time, the needs of the staff of law enforcement agencies to conduct online administrative law enforcement, and the real-time remote supervision needs of the legal system and efficiency supervision departments for administrative law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promotion process of the platform is mainly divided into five steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**One is to make a list of powers.**Comprehensively sort out relevant laws, regulations and rules, further clarify the basis, conditions, standards and procedures for the establishment of powers, compile a catalog of administrative powers, and list powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**The second is to clarify the power of discretion.**On the basis of clearing and confirming rights, focus on the refinement and quantification of the scope, conditions, and standards of various administrative enforcement powers, such as the scope, conditions, and standards, that have flexible space, and set limits by file, clarify administrative discretion standards, and reduce the discretionary space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**The third is R&amp;amp;D design and the establishment of a unified platform.**The platform is mainly composed of three parts: the online administrative law enforcement service hall, the online administrative law enforcement business handling system and the online administrative law enforcement electronic monitoring system. Early warning and error correction and performance evaluation and other functions. The online administrative law enforcement service hall relies on the Internet to disclose the legal basis, punishment standards, punishment results and basic information of law enforcement personnel to the public, so as to facilitate public supervision and complaints; the online administrative law enforcement business handling system is set up on the government affairs intranet to realize the handling of law enforcement cases The entire process of registration, case filing, investigation, enforcement, case closure, and reconsideration is handled electronically; the online administrative law enforcement electronic monitoring system is set up on the government affairs intranet, mainly to monitor the entire process of online administrative law enforcement behavior. The online administrative law enforcement platform is divided into provinces, cities, and counties. Through unified interface standards and unified data exchange formats, the interconnection and interoperability of the provincial, city, and county platforms will be realized, and data sharing, business collaboration, law enforcement norms, and supervision will eventually be formed. A powerful platform for online law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**The fourth is to implement electronic simultaneous monitoring.**On the online administrative law enforcement platform, four functions are established, including business process records of administrative law enforcement cases, traces of modification of illegal facts, multi-directional electronic monitoring and multi-dimensional statistical reports, so as to effectively manage the links and processes of case handling and eliminate the interference of human factors . In the process of handling law enforcement cases, through integrated supervision methods such as case process supervision, time limit supervision, abnormal case supervision, penalty result supervision, defect case supervision, etc., the whole process and all-round supervision of law enforcement behaviors are realized. At the same time, using the interconnection of online administrative law enforcement platforms, law enforcement departments at the provincial, city, and county levels can supervise the entire process of case handling, and legal institutions, administrative supervision and other departments can also supervise the entire process of law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Fifth, expand the scope of application and improve service functions.**While promoting the construction of an online administrative law enforcement platform, Fujian Province is vigorously building an online platform for the sunny operation of administrative power, which includes administrative approval, administrative law enforcement, public resource transactions, and electronic supervision. Administrative penalties have been extended to government procurement, land transfer, property rights transactions, construction projects and other fields, realizing the transformation from simple administrative functions to comprehensive government services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administrative law enforcement platform is the earliest, largest, most complex and most complete administrative law enforcement platform system in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system fully integrates key functions such as online law enforcement services, law enforcement business handling, and electronic monitoring, and the information sharing mechanism of &amp;ldquo;connection of two laws&amp;rdquo; can be directly realized on this platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;insufficient-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insufficient:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The construction of this system is too difficult for the grassroots, and it needs to be promoted by the province and city to be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;qiqihar-city-administrative-law-enforcement-platform&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qiqihar City Administrative Law Enforcement Platform:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Qiqihar City Administrative Law Enforcement Platform was officially launched on June 13, 2012. The platform has a total of 5 columns, including the disclosure of law enforcement, the law enforcement plan of administrative law enforcement departments, the reporting of administrative law enforcement, the inquiry of administrative punishment, and the supervision of administrative law enforcement effectiveness. At the same time, in order to ensure the orderly and effective operation of the law enforcement platform, the Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection has formulated management and assessment methods to assess the relevant law enforcement departments of the municipal government. In addition, the system has also adopted the method of pilot promotion, and the first batch of 11 administrative law enforcement departments opened the platform. It is understood that the administrative law enforcement platform will take several months from planning to establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;features&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unified acceptance platform. The reporting information is assigned by the background staff of the system to various functional departments for processing. After more than two years of operation, the reporting platform currently handles 285 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unified publicity platform. The system publicizes the law enforcement plans and administrative punishments of various administrative law enforcement departments, which can be queried at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unified supervision platform. In the operation of the system, the discipline inspection and supervision agencies are involved in the whole process, and the administrative efficiency supervision module is combined with the system, which can supervise and report administrative efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;insufficient-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insufficient:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is mainly used for the collection and transfer of complaints and the disclosure of punishment information, and does not integrate the case handling background and entity case supervision mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ningbo-administrative-law-enforcement-online-service-hall&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ningbo Administrative Law Enforcement Online Service Hall:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2012, Ningbo City established an online service hall for administrative law enforcement at the city and county levels to make public all administrative punishment cases, from the acceptance of the case to the end of the case, and the entire law enforcement process and supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online service hall was established by the supervision department of the Ningbo Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection, and its system consists of &amp;ldquo;two databases, two networks and two systems&amp;rdquo;. The administrative penalty discretionary database and administrative law enforcement law database in the system include the administrative penalty discretionary power of 40 law enforcement departments in the city. According to different circumstances, there are different grades and corresponding penalty types and punishment ranges. Penalties are refined and quantified There are 10,583 grades, and 3,348 national, provincial and municipal departments are included for inquiries by administrative law enforcement departments and the public. The administrative law enforcement special network, administrative law enforcement service hall network, law enforcement business system, and electronic monitoring system in the system will clearly present the whole process of each administrative law enforcement. Objects of punishment and other citizens, legal persons and organizations can log on to the website of the Administrative Law Enforcement Service Hall to inquire about discretionary power, the qualification certificate number of law enforcement personnel, publication and inquiry of punishment results, complaints and reports, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire handling process and results of all administrative punishment cases will be made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;insufficient-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insufficient:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system only integrates and releases the law enforcement information of various departments, and does not establish a unified acceptance and diversion platform, and the system only supports the public to report and complain about illegal or violations that occur during the law enforcement process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zibo-city-unified-administrative-law-enforcement-supervision-network-operation-platform&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zibo City Unified Administrative Law Enforcement Supervision Network Operation Platform:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to standardize the handling of administrative cases and administrative discretion, Zibo proposed in April 2014 to establish a unified network operation platform for administrative law enforcement supervision in the city. Zibo&amp;rsquo;s administrative law enforcement supervision network operation platform implements the integrated construction of district, county and city government departments, which are carried out simultaneously and share one platform to realize online case handling, online supervision, and online services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city plans to standardize the law enforcement process, refine the standards, improve the system, and operate online to realize the standardization, informationization, openness, real-time supervision and comprehensive coverage of the administrative punishment power, so as to ensure the lawful, standardized, open and reasonable exercise of the administrative punishment power . All the data of the administrative penalty subject database, administrative law enforcement personnel database, law enforcement basis law enforcement matter database and administrative penalty discretion benchmark database are implanted into the city&amp;rsquo;s unified administrative law enforcement supervision network operation system, and an administrative penalty matter coding management mechanism is established to solidify the law enforcement process. Except for public security, taxation, customs, commodity inspection and the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, all administrative law enforcement departments&amp;rsquo; punishment cases must be handled on the city&amp;rsquo;s unified administrative law enforcement supervision network platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city will make overall planning, and the two levels of government will simultaneously establish a platform for administrative law enforcement and administrative supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for specific fields, the handling and transfer of administrative cases are carried out on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;insufficient-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insufficient&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform has not yet been built, and the city is currently carrying out the &amp;ldquo;Administrative Law Enforcement Standardization Construction Year&amp;rdquo; campaign, and it will take time to unify the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;yiwu-unified-complaint-and-reporting-platform-for-administrative-law-enforcement&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yiwu unified complaint and reporting platform for administrative law enforcement:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the Yiwu Municipal Government promoted the Commission for Disciplinary Inspection, the Procuratorate and other departments to integrate the complaints, reports, and consultation telephones of the original 74 departments in Yiwu into 96150, making it a unified complaints and reports platform for administrative law enforcement in Yiwu. The platform is affiliated with the convenience service center of the municipal government and exists independently of the administrative law enforcement department, which provides a solid foundation for the implementation of the inspection agency&amp;rsquo;s law enforcement supervision power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform management center will dispatch the complaints and reports received to the relevant law enforcement and administrative responsible units through the network in the form of business orders according to the division of functions. The center will give feedback to the report and complaint consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;features&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish a unified administrative law enforcement complaint platform in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform management department is independent from the administrative department, which is convenient for supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;insufficient-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insufficient&lt;/strong&gt;:

The full text has more than 16,000 words. Due to time constraints, let&amp;rsquo;s go section by section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-is-the-paragraph-most-closely-related-to-personal-work&#34;&gt;The first is the paragraph most closely related to personal work:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political and legal committee is the organizational form for the party committee to lead the political and legal work, and it must be persisted for a long time. Political and legal committees of party committees at all levels should focus their work on grasping the political direction, coordinating the functions of all parties, coordinating political and legal work, building political and legal teams, supervising the performance of duties in accordance with the law, creating a fair judicial environment, taking the lead in handling affairs according to the law, and ensuring the correct and unified implementation of the Constitution and laws . The party organizations of political and legal organs must establish and improve a system for reporting major matters to the party committee. Strengthen the party building of political and legal organs, and give full play to the political guarantee role of party organizations and the vanguard and exemplary role of party members in the construction of the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been folk rumors that since Master Kong stepped down, the status of the Political and Legal Committee has plummeted, and it will even be revoked. But the result was just the opposite. This time, the central government vigorously seized power, using the Political and Legal Committee as the starting point, and continued to firmly control the various political and legal departments. And the leadership level of the Political and Legal Committee was raised from the central government to be directly controlled by the top leader, so as to avoid the situation where power is out of control again. To a certain extent, it reflects the style of the hawks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eyes of many scholars, the Political and Legal Committee is the source of the lack of separation between the party and the government, and the party&amp;rsquo;s use of the party to disrupt the law. The Political and Legal Committee randomly guides the public prosecutors to handle cases and intervenes in individual cases. It is one of the chief culprits that deteriorate the legal environment and create unjust, false and wrong cases. But in fact, judging from my work experience in the courts, public security, judiciary, and political and legal committees of the political and legal system in recent years, these accusations by scholars or folks seem to be caused by a one-size-fits-all problem. In the words of a vice-president during the investigation of a certain court two days ago: &amp;ldquo;Blindly directing cases and interfering in trials are things that can only be done by bumpkins in poor areas in the interior.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Xiaohe, there are many cases like this in your hometown.&amp;rdquo; &amp;quot; &amp;ldquo;How could this kind of thing happen in the Pearl River Delta region, it disappeared ten years ago.&amp;rdquo; Roughness is not rough, I personally agree with the words of the vice president. Although his words are slightly ridiculed, they are consistent with my judgment on the overall situation of the rule of law - the allocation of legal resources between regions Seriously unbalanced and the level of rule of law varies greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my personal point of view, my current work is mainly to coordinate various political and legal agencies to solve practical difficulties, and focus on solving the difficulties of various agencies in handling cases in the field of people&amp;rsquo;s livelihood that are of concern to the masses. Some of these problems involve multiple power departments, and we need to take the lead in coordination; some involve very professional work fields, and we need to study the direction of solving them; some involve major group interests, and we need to create a stable environment for handling cases; Some involve the fundamental interests of the masses, but they cannot be resolved through legal channels. We need to provide assistance and study preventive measures. These are real personal work issues at present, and the decision-making mentioned by the central government is consistent from theory to reality. But the problem is that not every region has the same political and legal environment as my region. Even within the Pearl River Delta, there are still many regions with various problems, and most of the work is in the form, the rule of law environment is not optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;just-like-these-two-paragraphs&#34;&gt;Just like these two paragraphs:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implement the final trial and litigation termination system, implement the separation of appeals and interviews, and ensure that the parties exercise their appeal rights in accordance with the law. For appeals against effective judgments and decisions of judicial organs, the system of representation by lawyers shall be gradually implemented. Complainants who cannot afford a lawyer are included in the scope of legal aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improve the linkage mechanism between administrative law enforcement and criminal justice, improve the standards and procedures for case transfer, establish information sharing, case notification, and case transfer systems for administrative law enforcement agencies, public security organs, procuratorial organs, and judicial organs, and resolutely overcome cases that cannot be transferred and cannot be transferred. , Punishment instead of punishment phenomenon, to achieve a seamless connection between administrative punishment and criminal punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;separation of lawsuits and interviews&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;connection of the two laws&amp;rdquo; mentioned in the middle of these two paragraphs are one of the key tasks of our Political and Legal Committee this year. In the past 10 years, the complaint work has been in a hurry, brewing a large number of mass incidents, major cases, unjust, false and wrongly decided cases, which seriously damaged the credibility of the judiciary and restricted the development of a society ruled by law. The deepening of erroneous ideas such as lawsuits and haunting visits will restrict the development of the rule of law for a long time to come. The &amp;ldquo;separation of complaints and visits&amp;rdquo; is currently the first step in solving this major problem. Although staggering, since the pilot reform of &amp;ldquo;separation of complaints and visits&amp;rdquo; launched by the central government at the end of last year, my region has basically completed the separation of the field of complaints and complaints related to law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Combination of the two laws&amp;rdquo; is an extremely professional field. Due to the unbalanced power development of the government in recent years, various administrative law enforcement powers are overflowing, but the supervision of administrative law enforcement powers is difficult. In the Peng Zhen era, the general supervision power of the procuratorate over administrative agencies was directly rejected, resulting in the long-term inability to obtain independent supervision in the field of administrative law enforcement, which led to a large number of &amp;ldquo;substituting punishment for punishment&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;not punishing the guilty&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;penal money&amp;rdquo; in reality. transaction” phenomenon. It is almost impossible for the general supervision power to be taken back to the procuratorate, but the &amp;ldquo;connection of the two laws&amp;rdquo; is a very important supplementary method, that is, the procuratorate can supervise the law enforcement behavior of the administrative agency in the field of punishment, at least in key areas. The agency&amp;rsquo;s law enforcement behavior has been monitored. But at the same time, &amp;ldquo;connecting the two laws&amp;rdquo; is currently an extremely difficult task. There are tens of millions of administrative law enforcement powers, and the units with law enforcement powers are more powerful than the other. It is completely impossible to rely on the procuratorate to do it alone. Therefore, the local political law The coordinating role played by the Commission is crucial. Some people may have doubts. It is enough for our procuratorate to exercise its procuratorial power in accordance with the law and handle cases independently. Why does Mao need you to coordinate with the Political and Legal Committee? The key point is that even if the procuratorate handles the case itself, in the professional field of &amp;ldquo;connection of the two laws&amp;rdquo;, there are not many prosecutors in China who can handle it. You still have to learn from the beginning, start from the beginning, and move forward step by step. What&amp;rsquo;s more, even if prosecutors can handle cases, the public security has to learn it. The number of public security police is 100 times the number of prosecutors. What&amp;rsquo;s more, there are millions of civil servants who have law enforcement power behind them. It takes several years for the &amp;ldquo;Three Represents&amp;rdquo;, how can it be possible to learn those things in the &amp;ldquo;connection of the two laws&amp;rdquo; in a short time. In the end, everyone doesn&amp;rsquo;t learn, everyone doesn&amp;rsquo;t practice, slack off each other, and the law does not blame the public. It is still the same as before, no progress at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-mode-of-cohesion-of-two-methods-is-as-follows&#34;&gt;The mode of &amp;ldquo;cohesion of two methods&amp;rdquo; is as follows:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the illegal acts discovered by the administrative law enforcement agencies during law enforcement constitute a crime, the case shall be transferred to the public security. The public security examines the cases transferred by the administrative law enforcement agencies. If the conditions are not met, the cases will not be filed. If the cases meet the conditions, they will be investigated and then transferred to the procuratorate. The procuratorate receives the case transferred by the public security, examines and prosecutes it, does not prosecute if it does not meet the conditions, and initiates a public prosecution if it meets the conditions. The court judges and executes according to law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;here-comes-the-problem-there-are-a-lot-of-difficult-problems-in-the-middle-tucao-mode&#34;&gt;Here comes the problem, there are a lot of difficult problems in the middle: (Tucao mode)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. There are tens of thousands of administrative law enforcement powers, and the ability of administrative agencies is limited, so it may not be possible to find that administrative violations constitute crimes; 2. The procuratorate&amp;rsquo;s ability is limited, and it may not be possible to find that the administrative punishment imposed by the administrative agency is &amp;ldquo;replacing punishment with punishment&amp;rdquo;; 3. The capacity of the administrative agency is limited, and it is almost impossible to collect criminal evidence (the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that it can only be done by political and legal agencies); 4. The capacity of the public security organs is limited, and cases with difficult to verify criminal clues or insufficient evidence can only be returned to the administrative organs; 5. When encountering a returned case, the administrative agency does not know how to deal with it. Transfer it, the police refused to accept it, don&amp;rsquo;t transfer it, dereliction of duty. . . 6. The punishment of the administrative agency is fines, detaining certificates, detentions, etc. The evidence requirements are extremely simple, and you can be fined by sticking plasters; 7. The police want to arrest and convict people, and the evidence requirements are extremely strict. The punishment basis provided by your administrative agency is a pile of waste paper; 8. Why did the procuratorate go? The procuratorate didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. You can&amp;rsquo;t tell me that the procuratorate collects evidence by itself and then submits it to the police, and then let the police transfer it back, and then prosecute. 9. What about the courts? The courts still have headaches. The court still has a bunch of cases of refusal to enforce rulings and judgments waiting to be transferred to the police. My court has determined that this kid refuses to execute, which is already a crime. Whether you will be caught by the police or not. The police arrested him, whether the procuratorate will prosecute him or not, your court said he committed a crime, and my public security department is still making a fuss. Is this a lynching by default?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, things like the independence of the judiciary are still difficult to achieve at present. The coordination function of the party committee still has a strong viability in the current country where the rule of man is still strong, but. . . . Not every local political and legal committee has the ability to promote these tasks. I hope they don&amp;rsquo;t follow in the footsteps of &amp;ldquo;urban management&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamic clock icon on IOS7 is a rare dynamic icon in the IOS interface. Its design is indeed unique, but after careful observation, it is not difficult to find that the elements on this clock are indeed extremely simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On PPT, it is often necessary to use some eye-catching dynamic effects to enhance the taste of the entire PPT. The dynamic clock is a special element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture below is the clock style in IOS7, and the following is the imitation of this clock on the PPT.&lt;/p&gt;

What I imitated tonight is an arc-shaped circular color circle. Since the process is a bit cumbersome, I made a simple tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the imitation is a 12-segment ring, each segment is 30 degrees. For accurate realization, it needs to be calibrated with the help of a triangle. What needs to be paid attention to when making an isosceles triangle is to ensure that the apex is on the midline.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/dont-forget-your-original-intention-regain-simplicity/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/dont-forget-your-original-intention-regain-simplicity/images/OIP-C-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post Don&#39;t forget your original intention, regain simplicity" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer when I was 14 years old, I saw a Lenovo mobile phone advertisement on the middle page advertisement of a &amp;ldquo;Reader&amp;rdquo;. At that time, Lenovo had not yet acquired the PC business of Big Blue, but it was already booming in China, with computers, mobile phones, printers, cameras, and many 3C fields having its presence. At the time, I didn’t remember much about the content of the advertisement, but the 999 yuan color-screen mobile phone left a deep impression on me, so I encouraged my mother, without telling my father, to use the mobile phone’s built-in electronic dictionary function, and successfully defrauded me of financial support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(The following content is nonsense, watch carefully)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was young, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the heights of the heavens and the depths of the earth. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how deep the sewage was in the mobile phone industry in a small county. With 1,500 yuan in cash (at that time, the tuition fee for a semester of high school was 1,500 yuan), I walked onto the chopping block of profiteers.&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/dont-forget-your-original-intention-regain-simplicity/images/5-Lenove-G620C-300x300.webp&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, this mobile phone is the first real electronic device in my life. Before that, the tape machines and radios I had come into contact with were only played occasionally in the hands of older friends. Even in the second year of junior high school, in order to listen to the Korea-Japan World Cup in class, I cheated my parents 15 yuan in the name of buying an electronic alarm clock, and privately bought the simplest black FM radio. But these are unimportant. In the situation of scarcity of various resources in the big countryside, any novelty can inspire endless interests and hobbies. Internet cafes with dial-up Internet access, 10 yuan an hour Internet fee, make parents panic. And the first time I saw at my cousin&amp;rsquo;s house that it was no longer running the school&amp;rsquo;s MSDOS system, but could play extremely cheating games such as CS, and it left an indelible mark in my heart all year round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my first mobile phone, Lenovo&amp;rsquo;s G620C did not disappoint me. The only regret is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support java, so I can&amp;rsquo;t run QQ or something. Other 32-polyphonic ringtones, 1.5-inch 64k color flip screen, English-Chinese Chinese-English dictionary, etc., a bunch of functions that looked tall at the time really added a lot of fun to life.&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/dont-forget-your-original-intention-regain-simplicity/images/eebbk162416830-jpg.webp&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, with the gradual understanding of electronic products, mobile phones are no longer the only source of fun. Especially in the era when functional machines dominated, a large-screen backgammon electronic dictionary that can run rpg games, a screenless patriot mp3 with a 64MB capacity that can store nearly 100 low-bit-rate wma songs, and an entry-level Aihua cassette player The happiness it brings is far better than that of mobile phones. Especially when PHS became popular in 2005 and 2006, under the crazy pressure of getting a PHS mobile phone for 100 yuan of phone bill, the mobile phone did not seem to be as important as it was later thought. Until after college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the start of university, TV shopping 999 bought Changhong Xiaozhiling. But after using it for one semester, at the beginning of the second semester, I lost it on the bus, so that I spent 120 yuan on the Internet in desperation, and bought a second (&amp;gt; 2) hands on Baidu Youah (which has closed down). BlackBerry 7290, this is the beginning of a new era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BlackBerry 7290 is an extremely classic product. The amazing side scroll wheel design, the clearer screen under sunlight, 16M large storage space, various available software, and the invincible full keyboard on the earth, make this old machine, which is several years behind Europe and the United States, come back to life in my mobile phone. After quickly falling into the quagmire of BlackBerry design, it has successively upgraded and replaced BlackBerry 8700, 7130, 8820, 8310, 8900, 9780 and other models, just like a BlackBerry lover. During this period, other brands of mobile phones also showed their splendor, but I always stick to the BlackBerry line and despise other brands. Since the BlackBerry 9700, the mobile phone platform competition has been rapidly accelerating, and the disadvantages of BlackBerry have also begun to be infinitely magnified, and the situation has been declining and leaking thousands of miles. The 9900, z10, etc. that were released later, after I have already started with Samsung galaxy note and galaxy s3, I already feel that I am not interested.&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/dont-forget-your-original-intention-regain-simplicity/images/rimblackberry7290-1356315219-3-jpg.webp&#34;

&lt;p&gt;These two Samsung mobile phones do not seem to bring a better experience now. It can only be said to be an ordinary Android phone, where the stuck place is unambiguous, and there is also a flaw in the font door. The cost of the hardware and maintenance of the two mobile phones before and after is over ten thousand. This cost is already very high for the Android system. Especially after domestic brands such as Xiaomi, Meizu, and vivo have shined, the cost performance of Samsung&amp;rsquo;s flagship phones is very low.&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/dont-forget-your-original-intention-regain-simplicity/images/samsung-galaxy-note-featured-jpg.webp&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Android platform is very open and various applications and functions emerge in an endless stream, after two years of experience, some deep-seated problems have been discovered. A summary of what I can&amp;rsquo;t bear is probably as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROM and power consumption issues. While smartphones are generally fast drainers, Android is the winner. The power consumption of the official ROM is slightly better controlled when there are fewer applications installed. This is why many mobile phones consume less power during evaluation, but the power consumption is very fast when they are actually used. The official ROM is not well-beautified and ugly. Without ROOT, a large number of system built-in junk applications and a large number of rogue apps are running in the background, resulting in a sharp increase in power consumption; the official ROM may be unstable after rooting, especially after flashing the Internet. In some modified versions of the system, the power consumption problem is difficult to control. Many modified ROMs on the Internet will claim to improve the power consumption problem, but in fact they have not solved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROM as a whole is a very serious problem. A large number of third-party ROMs or modified official ROMs appear on the Internet, resulting in a substantial increase in built-in rogue software, backdoors and hacking programs. It is very important to find a safe and secure ROM. difficult. Although there are products like MIUI that seem more reliable, power consumption is also a very big problem when running on non-Xiaomi mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to fight against the background startup and permission tentacles of countless rogue software on Android, software such as autostarts or lbe optimization master was used to control it before, but the problem is that although these control software can better control the background application, they can be used in routine operations. Especially troublesome, from time to time you have to clean up memory and modify permissions. The control software itself is also very power-hungry. miui comes with an lbe control module, which is more convenient and simple, but there are still problems in supporting non-Xiaomi phones.&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/dont-forget-your-original-intention-regain-simplicity/images/screenshot1.png&#34;

&lt;p&gt;The brutal development of Android has led to the fact that there are almost only three roads for the development of mobile phones: the screen specifications are constantly increasing, the hardware parameters are constantly being refreshed, and the thickness of the body is constantly shrinking. None of these three have much guiding significance for me. False propaganda emerges endlessly, and all kinds of marketing that destroys the three views abound, but the product itself has no substantial development. CPU, screen, circuit, camera, the production of these main components, there are only a few companies on the market that can do it, so the components used in most mobile phones are almost the same, and the same system is used, the actual difference is only Unscrupulous marketing and after-sales behind the price and price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the components of an Android phone are highly standardized, it is not difficult to assemble a mobile phone, but few manufacturers on the market can really understand these components and the connections between them. Most manufacturers only pursue the products they want to make now. According to this demand, they can make a list of purchases, assembly and marketing. There is no unified and reasonable hardware development plan. The upstream suppliers can do whatever they can provide. As for the products provided by the upstream No one cares about how effective it can be and where future products will go. Of course, consumers don’t need to know what mobile phone manufacturers have done. Consumers only need to know whether the product is good or not, and the information they get is just a series of parameters listed by the manufacturer: the parameters are not very meaningful. . The same audio decoding chip, some companies feel that the effect is not good after using it on a mobile phone once, and then replace it with another one next time. In their eyes, only the latest and highest parameter chips can bring more gimmicks; and there are also companies that, after using this chip for the first time, gradually became familiar with the functions of this chip. After several years of continuous research and software optimization on this chip, they finally formed a set that can last for a long time The scheme used. This is the true portrayal of the entire industry at present. The former is a company other than Apple, and the latter is only Apple.&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/dont-forget-your-original-intention-regain-simplicity/images/pi15726-jpg.webp&#34;

&lt;p&gt;The same hardware, in the hands of different manufacturers, has completely different effects. An obvious example is the 13-megapixel camera made by Sony. Most of the 13-megapixel cameras on the market use the Sony imx135 photoreceptor, but the photo effects of different mobile phones vary widely, and even Sony’s own photo effects are in the middle and low list, because the use of hardware requires algorithms Cooperating with software, excellent algorithms and software optimization cannot be reflected in hardware parameter lists and marketing advertisements. Consumers cannot feel these background virtual services before purchasing, which is not very useful for product sales. In order to save software and optimize costs, most manufacturers have led to mobile phones with exactly the same hardware parameters on the market, and the realization and effect of various functions vary greatly. &lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/dont-forget-your-original-intention-regain-simplicity/images/Sony-IMX135-stacked-image-sensor2-jpg.webp&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, at the end of the day, there seems to be no other choice but Nokia and Apple. Since Nokia&amp;rsquo;s new flagship has obvious shortcomings in camera speed and software richness, only Apple can choose. This is indeed a joke. There are so many mobile phones of all kinds on the market, but in the end, I have no choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IOS system experience time is also very long, the earliest itouch started, and then ipad and iadmini, the overall impression is very good, the quality of hardware and software is very high, although there are many obvious deficiencies, but in the end, this is a For products that don’t bother, you don’t need to worry too much about system problems, power consumption problems, mobile phone hardware performance problems, software application problems, and various multimedia tool usage problems such as taking pictures and playing music. And the current model, after throwing away the low portability of the 5-inch and 6-inch large screens, is particularly valuable. In fact, in addition to viewing pictures and videos, even if the screen is large, the visual range of the eyes to read text is also limited. It is very narrow, and even when you only look at two or three lines at a time, you will pull down the screen. This is because the convenience of touching the screen with your fingers is much easier than floating up and down with your head and eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone is a simple but not mediocre product. The simple performance of the front desk represents countless optimization efforts in the background, so that the hardware parameters that are not outstanding have made the most excellent product. And this concept is also what I have been pursuing in recent years: no matter what, treatment cannot be given up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The boundary between insult and unlawful detention</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/the-boundary-between-insult-and-unlawful-detention/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 07 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/the-boundary-between-insult-and-unlawful-detention/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/the-boundary-between-insult-and-unlawful-detention/images/AAP3_M-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post The boundary between insult and unlawful detention" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original text on Weibo: [A woman in Quanzhou entered a store to steal two pieces of bread and was tied to a pole for public display] Southeast Morning Post: On the morning of the 4th, a woman was caught by the shopkeeper on the spot when she stole two pieces of bread on Zhongshan Middle Road, Anhai Town, Jinjiang. In order to warn her and prevent her from committing crimes again, the owner, Mr. Lin, tied the thief to a telephone pole and hung a cardboard with &amp;ldquo;I am a thief&amp;rdquo; on his chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;crime of illegal detention&lt;/strong&gt;, refers to the act of illegally depriving others of their personal freedom by detention, confinement or other coercive methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insult&lt;/strong&gt;, refers to the use of violence or other methods to openly demean the personality of others, damage the reputation of others, and the circumstances are serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 238: Whoever illegally detains others or deprives others of their personal freedom by other means shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, short-term detention, public surveillance or deprivation of political rights. If there are circumstances of beating or humiliating, a heavier punishment shall be given. Whoever commits the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph and causes serious injury shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than ten years; and whoever causes death shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than ten years. Whoever uses violence to cause injury, disability or death shall be convicted and punished in accordance with the provisions of Articles 234 and 232 of this Law. Whoever illegally seizes or detains others for the purpose of extorting debts shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of the preceding two paragraphs. State organ functionaries who commit crimes in the preceding three paragraphs by taking advantage of their powers shall be given heavier punishments in accordance with the provisions of the preceding three paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 246 Whoever publicly insults others or fabricates facts to slander others by violence or other means, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, surveillance or deprivation of political rights. The crimes mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall only be dealt with upon complaint, except for cases that seriously endanger social order and national interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Regulations on the Standards of the People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate for Directly Accepting Cases for Filing and Investigating Cases (Trial)&amp;rdquo; clearly stipulates that the crime of illegal detention must exceed 24 hours. The case should also be filed, that is, &amp;ldquo;illegally detaining others for more than 24 hours&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;illegally detaining others and performing acts of binding, beating, insulting, etc.&amp;rdquo; are objective behavioral manifestations of the crime of illegal detention, and there is no time limit for illegal detention in the latter case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what the motive is, as long as there is the purpose of illegally depriving others of their personal liberty, and the purpose of illegally detaining others is intentional, it constitutes the crime of illegal detention. If the illegal deprivation of personal freedom is for other criminal purposes, the punishment for other crimes is heavier than the crime of illegal detention. should be punished as other crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illegal detention for more than 24 hours has insulting circumstances, and insulting behavior constitutes a crime. This situation should belong to several crimes, and should be punished as the crime of illegal detention and the crime of insulting (or the crime of compulsively insulting women).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the crime of illegal detention, the provisions on &amp;ldquo;heavy punishment if there are circumstances of beating or insulting&amp;rdquo; should not include the situation that illegal detention and insulting behaviors constitute crimes at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deprivation of liberty must be unlawful. According to the law, the judiciary does not constitute the crime of illegal detention for persons with criminal facts and major suspicions who take compulsory measures such as detention and arrest to restrict personal freedom. However, if it is found that the arrest should not be made, and the person is not released with excuses and continues to be detained, it should be considered as illegal deprivation of personal liberty. For those who are committing crimes or are discovered in time after committing crimes, those who are wanted, those who have escaped from prison, or those who are being hunted down, it is a right, not illegal deprivation of personal freedom. Accepting mentally ill patients according to law is not an act of illegal deprivation of personal liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;7&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illegal detention did not exceed 24 hours, and there were insulting circumstances, and the insulting behavior constituted a crime. Since the constituent element of the crime of insult has the element of &amp;ldquo;openness&amp;rdquo;, and illegal detention is generally carried out in a secret state, the &amp;ldquo;crime of insult&amp;rdquo; in this case should be the crime of compulsively insulting women against women. Of course, if there are multiple people committing a crime together or multiple victims, it can also be considered as &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo;, then &amp;ldquo;insulting behavior constitutes a crime&amp;rdquo; may also refer to constituting the crime of insulting. In the case of the crime of insult, according to the judicial interpretation, it must also constitute the crime of illegal detention. This kind of situation belongs to the overlapping of laws and regulations. According to the principle of special law priority of overlapping and overlapping laws and regulations, in this case, illegal detention should be established. crime. When the crime of compulsively insulting women is constituted, a concurrent criminal offense shall also be established. If the illegal detention does not have other aggravating or transforming circumstances, the crime of compulsively insulting women is a felony. &amp;ldquo;principle, the crime of compulsively insulting women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illegal detention did not exceed 24 hours, and there were insulting circumstances, and the insulting behavior did not constitute a crime. Whether this situation constitutes a crime needs to be judged in light of the specific circumstances of the case.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Is Yu Qiuyu&#39;s MOB THOERY wrong?</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/is-yu-qiuyus-mob-theory-wrong/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/is-yu-qiuyus-mob-theory-wrong/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/is-yu-qiuyus-mob-theory-wrong/images/yqy-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post Is Yu Qiuyu&#39;s MOB THOERY wrong?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, there has been a little more content about Yu Qiuyu on Weibo, among which the following two are more representative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Yu Qiuyu publishes &amp;ldquo;Mob Theory&amp;rdquo;: &amp;ldquo;Everyone who attacked me worshiped me&amp;rdquo;] Yu Qiuyu published a new book saying that attacking others for no reason is a sin. Those mobs who really lack morality use celebrities to complete their spiritual compensation. They will have criminal impulses when they see wealth, sex, and power, but because they have nowhere to vent their criminal impulses, they can only reluctantly sustenance by framing celebrities. Chinese celebrities must undertake psychological projection obligations for these people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yu Qiuyu said that after six years of reflection and in-depth research on Chinese society, he finally discovered that China&amp;rsquo;s problem is not a problem of tyranny, but a problem of the mob. It was the mob that launched the Cultural Revolution. public opinion. Because there are too many mobs in this nation, there are continuous earthquakes, floods, gangsters, Tang Fuzhen set himself on fire, and Zhao Zuohai reversed the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is already the Nth time I have written about Yu Qiuyu in an article. It is really because he had a huge influence in my middle school days. From now on, most of the influences are quite positive. As for the attacking remarks circulated on the Internet in recent years, most of them laughed it off. Yu himself said: &amp;ldquo;When they see money, sex, and power, they will have a criminal impulse, but what the society has set up is a series of moral models. , They have nowhere to vent their criminal impulses, they can only rely on fantasies or framing of celebrities. Therefore, Chinese celebrities must bear such psychological projection obligations for these people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent attack on Yu Qiuyu seems to have a lot to do with his &amp;ldquo;mob theory&amp;rdquo;. When the word &amp;ldquo;mob&amp;rdquo; came into view, I immediately recalled the many articles I had seen on the analysis of Chinese society and people. However, due to the age, it is difficult to find the original text for only a few words, so I only posted it below. Out of what can be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the mob theory, there is actually an alternative term—the mob theory. When it comes to the mob, many people may feel disgusted, and they often resist because they tend to think of the ants-like good people under the tyranny of the ruling class. But gangsters should be much easier to accept, and it is not a day or two that Chinese society is called a gangster society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called mob refers to a group of human beings gathered together with a homogeneous and uniform psychological consciousness. They reject rational and complex thinking, and simply choose two extremes for various opinions, ideas and beliefs provided to them, or accept them completely. , or reject it altogether as either absolute truth or absolute falsehood. As for Yu Qiuyu, people generally have only two kinds of mentality towards celebrities, especially Yu Qiuyu, who has been famous in the past. Either they think he is a good person and admire and look up to him; opportunity for justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a lot of human flesh searches in China or, for example, the current movement-style pursuit of the death penalty. As early as a few years ago, Russian newspapers publicly published comments asking Russia to learn the lessons of China’s gangster society:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is like a revolution in Internet culture. People are rushing from virtual cyberspace to real life, passionately intervening in other people&amp;rsquo;s private lives. This can be called a major feature of China&amp;rsquo;s Internet life.&amp;rdquo; Russian media said, China Netizens are not stingy about executing XXX in the cruelest way. The rapid development of China&amp;rsquo;s Internet has also greatly changed the way information is disseminated. Public opinion on the Internet is involved in the real life of individuals, which is a kind of &amp;ldquo;entertainment mass movement.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between that and the mob during the French Revolution?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the examples in real life, due to the involvement of too many complicated factors, tend to make people transfer all problems to the government in a logical manner, which is not so convincing, so the following paragraphs can be expressed more naturally It shows the essence of Chinese gangster society:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leifeng Pagoda, a cultural relic building with a historical background of thousands of years and one of the ten scenic spots of the West Lake, because the common people say that the bricks of this pagoda can &amp;ldquo;ward off evil spirits&amp;rdquo; when brought home, so they secretly dug up the bricks of Leifeng Pagoda one after another. I moved home one after another. According to the people&amp;rsquo;s opinion: I just move a brick, which is not considered a crime. So, in the end, Leifeng Pagoda collapsed under such &amp;ldquo;collective unconscious crime&amp;rdquo; behavior, leaving no bones left! In Lu Xun&amp;rsquo;s works, the sudden collapse of Leifeng Pagoda was attributed to the contribution of each &amp;ldquo;common people&amp;rdquo;. Everyone was greedy for a little bit of money and carried a brick home, creating a tragedy. And if the whole people participate in this kind of &amp;ldquo;group crime&amp;rdquo;, I am afraid that it is not just a simple Leifeng Pagoda that will be toppled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the dynasties, common people usually curse corrupt officials and power monopolies, because those people often have smoother channels than us to obtain benefits that they should not deserve. We often say: officials are black and ugly, while the people are innocent and kind-in fact, this is a self-deceiving rhetoric. As long as ordinary people gain some kind of power (even if it is temporary), when they have the opportunity to change the rules of the game, their group crimes and collective theft are no different from those of corrupt officials and corrupt elements, and they even behave more blatantly. , is even more frightening, because——everyone openly believes that they are not at fault. The people and the officials belong to the same group. And this group is the people of our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the thinking of Chinese people today, the ten-year historical event from 1966 to 1976 has always been an ugly scar on the country and the nation (the Cultural Revolution). As an individual of every common man, he has reason to be full of righteous indignation towards this period of history. Almost all the people blame it on the leaders of the country, thinking that it is completely the evil result of individual centralization-this kind of argument is especially prevalent among the generation aged 40-60 today, they have become the dominant group in society today, naturally With the right to evaluate the past history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is precisely not the case. If it weren&amp;rsquo;t for the amazing destructive power of the Chinese group itself, if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the traditional psychology of suspicion, jealousy, and mutual adjustment among people, if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for the group criminal thinking accumulated by our nation for thousands of years, I would It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that just relying on someone&amp;rsquo;s call can set off such a big wave? The inferiority of Chinese people&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;selective blindness&amp;rdquo; has once again been exposed: it is precisely people in the age group of 40-60, who, in the event that lasted for ten years, coincided with the angry youth of their youth—— It was them who starred in this tragedy. They used their destructive power and imagination by analogy, and made a classic debut performance of the inferiority of the entire nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, these young people in their 20s, like many angry young people on the Internet today, chanted &amp;ldquo;revolution&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;reformation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;rebellion is justified&amp;rdquo;, full of resentment and provocation against everything about the current system, they Looks like no one, bites anyone. This group&amp;rsquo;s rebellion against their superiors and elders has evolved from &amp;ldquo;Wen Dou&amp;rdquo; big-character posters and &amp;ldquo;breaking the four olds&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;War Fighting&amp;rdquo; to smashing, looting, and ransacking homes. The Red Guards uphold the &amp;ldquo;radical is justice&amp;rdquo; Fanatical beliefs, destructive impact on state organs and government systems, especially when dealing with old revolutionaries and old comrades who fought in the country, these young people showed their inner viciousness to the fullest: kicking, insulting, shaving Dysentery as an insult to personality, wearing high hats, hanging stickers to parade in the streets, breaking into private houses to search, wantonly confiscating other people&amp;rsquo;s property&amp;hellip; This is tantamount to a large-scale group crime, and the criminals even call it &amp;ldquo;justice&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;. Later on, churches were smashed, temples were smashed, graves were dug, cultural classics were burned, and cultural relics and historic sites were destroyed. Later victims gradually involved businessmen, upper-level democrats, famous writers, famous actors, and middle school teachers—and among them In addition, the Red Guards evolved representatives of different forces, &amp;ldquo;rebels&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ultra-leftists&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;conservatives&amp;rdquo;. It has become a gangster-style world of rivers and lakes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The relationship between work, study, life and BlackBerry</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/work-study-life-blackberry/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/work-study-life-blackberry/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/work-study-life-blackberry/images/2009814115601-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post The relationship between work, study, life and BlackBerry" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I started using BlackBerry in 2007, I can be regarded as a relatively experienced BlackBerry user in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been a player who prefers to play with emerging electronic products, but since the moment I bought a second-hand 7290 at a low price in 2007 due to the explosion of various cups, all this seems to be quietly changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more appropriate description would be: &amp;ldquo;Since using the BlackBerry, I don&amp;rsquo;t play with my mobile phone very much, which naturally improves the work efficiency of other activities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, getting this description is not fabricated out of thin air, but an epiphany when RT other people&amp;rsquo;s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the following push is very real. Since I have used BlackBerry, if I talk about mobile phones, I will basically start with applications such as information communication and email. Compared with other platforms, games and entertainment functions are almost not too Many people care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important factor is what I read in &amp;ldquo;New Weekly&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xie Guorui, President of RIM (Blackberry) China&lt;/strong&gt;According to the slow development of BlackBerry in China these years and the frantic growth of Apple, it is concluded that:Young people use blackberries to appear mature, and &amp;ldquo;older business leaders&amp;rdquo; use apples to appear tender.He extended the reason why young people like to use BlackBerry as: &amp;ldquo;Workhard, playhard, to be a leader&amp;rdquo;. This is the slogan he made up for BlackBerry in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how relevant is Blackberry to work, study and life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my personal experience (I am not a white-collar worker at present, and it is rare for companies to open BES services. I just look at this issue from the role of a student or just entering the society),The biggest contribution of BlackBerry to work and study is that most people will not always play games or toss about things that don&amp;rsquo;t make much sense with their BlackBerry phones.BlackBerry plays a diligent tool role in users&amp;rsquo; lives. Most of its applications are based on improving work and study efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the course of my university studies, the translation and interpretation of various words, the direct reading of DOC/PDF files, mobile phone text reading and web browsing are the most core applications, and BlackBerry can often do all these tasks. And let me realize the needs of these information acquisitions in the best or fastest way. I don&amp;rsquo;t deny that other mobile phones can also implement similar applications, butWith the advantages of its full keyboard and various shortcut keys, BlackBerry brings these tools into full play to a very high level.You can set any program in the BlackBerry to the shortcut key to realize the most convenient tool operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a relatively closed smart operating platform, BlackBerry has obvious security and stability. For me, stability is the first to bear the brunt. In the course of many years of use, there is almost no impression of the phone crashing. The only unpleasant experience occurred in a very small number of domestic imperfect programs, which will cause the program itself to crash. This is undoubtedly due to the powerful &amp;ldquo;virtual machine&amp;rdquo; running of Blackberry ability. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is an appropriate description, in my impression,BlackBerry&amp;rsquo;s software platform is like a &amp;ldquo;virtual machine&amp;rdquo; like a &amp;ldquo;sandbox&amp;rdquo;, all third-party programs are running in such a &amp;ldquo;box&amp;rdquo;, even if the program in the box goes wrong, it will not affect the background system that operates the box. Coupled with BlackBerry&amp;rsquo;s own powerful multitasking and extremely powerful engineering mode, it can be said that the daily application of 99.99% will be based on a fairly stable state, unless the immature deletion of system files has caused problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blackberrymultitaskingIt is quite beneficial for daily work, because I never need to worry about the loss of previous work or other adverse consequences when a new task is not finished.&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://berrytimes.cn/2010/04/05/multi-task-of-blackberry-9700/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;test&lt;/a&gt;Keeping the phone running smoothly by running 57 mainstream applications on the BlackBerry 9700 at the same time is the best proof. Under normal circumstances, it is very common for individuals to use mobile phones to run 10-15 programs in the background at the same time, and itsFast switching between programsAlso commendable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the originator and model of the full keyboard,The effect of blackberry on text inputIn terms of technology, it has always been the leader in the industry. Although some models did not support Chinese input very well in the early days (especially the sad 7130 series), after the 5.0 system, the convenience of built-in Chinese pinyin input has been significantly improved. Of course , if you use Wubi, it is self-evident. There was a huge post with details&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://bbs.maxpda.com/thread-394426-1-1.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Compare&lt;/a&gt;I have passed the BlackBerry 8900 and E72, and I can say about the input of the mobile phone&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://bbs.maxpda.com/redirect.php?goto=findpost&amp;amp;ptid=394426&amp;amp;pid=7268949&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;watch here&lt;/a&gt;. It can be said that in terms of text input, BlackBerry has achieved the top position in the entire industry. It only needs a little familiarity with the input rules of BlackBerry to quickly experience the input pleasure similar to that of a PC keyboard. This is undoubtedly an important way to improve work efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mail, as an application that has been neglected by most Chinese for a long time, may be used as a substitute for occasional reading or when QQ is not enough to transmit so much information offline. But as a user who uses BlackBerry, in any case, he will gradually change his habits to adapt to the email life. For example, I do everything possible to search for various solutions to use mail to perform many originally complicated operations. For example, update blogs, microblogs, and website information by email, or use email to chat or communicate with others in depth.There is no doubt that in the field of mobile phone mail transmission, BlackBerry is the first in the entire industry, Even mobile phones such as Nokia, Motorola or Samsung have to purchase BlackBerry&amp;rsquo;s application technology authorization in the field of mail applications.Using email to update Wordpress and Weibo, and using email to subscribe to a variety of rich professional information is one of my favorite BlackBerry applications.Of course, I don&amp;rsquo;t rule out that other mobile phones can do the same, but there is no doubt that BlackBerry is the best. (I have to mention Berrymail here. As a non-profit email service, Titto and others have made outstanding contributions to domestic users who have not opened BIS/BES.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding software application, whether it can improve the efficiency of work and study is mainly reflected in the details. At the beginning, I was quite disdainful of the software/apps that come with BlackBerry. I always thought that the built-in schedule management, browser, notepad, alarm, automatic switch, and scene mode were too simple and poor. But after playing all kinds of applications, I found out that in fact, the built-in applications of BlackBerry, such as schedule management, although I was not used to it at the beginning, I always made mistakes in the time judgment, but after a period of time I got used to it. , I found that the schedule management thing is so useful, without it, I really don&amp;rsquo;t know that my Thunder offline file will expire on Wednesday afternoon this week, and Thursday is my grandma&amp;rsquo;s birthday, these rather trivial events in life and work. This is like the lethality of Itunes on Ipod users. When Apple users have to use itunes for music management, they all find that they can no longer do without Apple&amp;rsquo;s services, because the cost of transferring to other platforms is no longer a cost. For such a simple thing as software or hardware products, I have had this before&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hyruo.com/2011/02/itunes.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt;Pass.BlackBerry&amp;rsquo;s built-in software applications, like the color of Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Logo, have a universal effect. It does not pursue uniqueness, but tries to design for users from a universal perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is the automatic switch setting. I once thought that I needed a highly liberal control software that can automatically shut down at 11:00 on Monday night, turn on at 7:00 on Tuesday morning, turn off at 12:30 on Tuesday night, and turn on at 9:00 on Wednesday morning. Of course, there are many such software, but unfortunately after using it for a while, I found that I don’t need this kind of service at all. Procedural deficiencies. In order to find fault with a piece of software, I actually forced myself to live an irregular life. Such absurd things actually happen often in life. When you fully perceive that your behavior is outrageous, it is the time to improve your life experience. Similarly, on the alarm clock, I also had this ridiculous idea. In fact, the BlackBerry alarm clock with systems above 5.0 is an extremely user-friendly product. The thoughtful pillow mode and exquisite UI design, rich functions and almost ubiquitous screen saver display are undoubtedly the development history of BlackBerry OS. a new height in .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackberry rarely entertains software/games, during my years of use, the entertainment game software that has been kept the longest is Nintaii (it seems to be cleared shortly after installation, but it is always installed on the mobile phone), Escape (not cleared so far) and Sudoku (now basically brushing records ) These three intellectual games almost accompany me most of the toilet time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game performance is the first factor for many young people to consider buying a mobile phone, but it is a pity that BlackBerry does not have as rich game resources as other platforms, which is directly related to its mobile phone user positioning.As a sign of business people/young people pretending to be mature, how decent is it if you still play games with your mobile phone all day long?Games are undoubtedly the factor that reduces productivity the most. Many of the high-quality games on the BlackBerry are related to intelligence, such as the above escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Originally, I planned to write some things about my work and study in this article, but I don’t know how to write it as Blackberry, FML&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to mobile phones and work and life, many people can’t help but think that their ownThe mobile phone must match your identity.How decent is it for a business person to shuttle between high-end office buildings with a three-card, three-standby counterfeit computer all day long?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brand is the first, and the style is the second. Of course, there is no need to say more about the brand of the BlackBerry. As for the appearance of the BlackBerry, different people have different opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time BlackBerry releases the so-called &amp;ldquo;spy photos&amp;rdquo; of a new model, people can&amp;rsquo;t help but want to scold their mother, why such an ugly thing came out again, but often as long as they see the real thing, they can&amp;rsquo;t help but marvel, it turns out that this TM is &amp;quot;&amp;quot; seeing is believing&amp;quot;! Perhaps for the first time, with Oriental wisdom,Blackberries are really ugly, especially when I first got the 7290, it was just a calculator with a larger screen, or an electronic dictionary like Wenquxing, which can be carried around the street all day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my 7290 broke down from the 4th floor, I bought the 7130, which looks less maverick Sure-type keyboard model (left), the key layout is similar to the familiar T9 key ( right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this BlackBerry, no matter how you look at it, it feels awkward~ Not to mention, the sales of BlackBerry with this key position are quite low.A BlackBerry without a full keyboard is like a kite with broken wings, without the ability to travel the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool appearance, is an important factor for many people to choose BlackBerry. It is generous and stable, which is in line with the psychological orientation of this group of people. It is a bit similar to the early Thinkpad. Therefore, BlackBerry is sometimes affectionately called &amp;ldquo;Little Black&amp;rdquo; by users just like Thinkpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of hardware, it must be mentioned thatblackberry screen, That was a shocking cry. In the market, there are basically no manufacturers who claim that their mobile phones only support 65,000 color screens, and this is one of the reasons why many users are hesitant when looking at the hardware specifications of BlackBerry. You are too outdated. Nokia launched a 260,000-color screen N years ago, and now 16 million colors are very popular. You are still wandering around with 65,000 colors&amp;hellip; It’s a pity that these people should have never experienced BlackBerry. The real phone, BlackBerry&amp;rsquo;s 65,000-color screen, basically surpasses other brands of mobile phones with the same level of resolution. For example, very few mobile phones can be viewed normally under the midday sun, but BlackBerry’s screen has always been able to do this (reflective screens such as 7290 needless to say, the stronger the external light, the clearer the view).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blackberry platformThe pressure on the hardware should be relatively smallYes, its applications and systems are not as resource-intensive as android or iphone. For example, I am using an 8900. From the engineering mode, I can see that the running memory (RAM) is only more than 30 MB, but it can still run many programs smoothly at the same time. , As for some newer models, the running ability of the BlackBerry program is even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I write here, it has nothing to do with life in general, and I digress quite far. I&amp;rsquo;ll stop here and talk about it next time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/the-behavior-someone-after-the-atm-has-not-taken-the-card/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/the-behavior-someone-after-the-atm-has-not-taken-the-card/images/ATM-scaled-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post The behavior of being withdrawn by someone after the ATM has not taken the card" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw this message on the campus QQ group tonight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, on March 5th, a classmate of our school ** forgot to take out the card after withdrawing money at the China Construction Bank ATM at the headquarters of Foshan University. Contact the bank card person (13695249899) to return the money, and promise not to pursue legal responsibility and keep it confidential. Otherwise, if it is not returned within a week, it will be handled by the police. You will be responsible for the legal responsibility. Don’t leave a criminal record to affect your future! Please help Chuan Chuan, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for the balance to be taken away due to failure to withdraw the card after the ATM operation, and some people even wait for others to forget the card. ¹Of course, if the above information is true, I believe that based on years of experience in the university, the &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; who withdraws the money later should have done it on a temporary basis. After all, the school is a relatively closed place. Behaviors such as &amp;ldquo;spotting&amp;rdquo; to withdraw money are obviously not in line with the criminal psychology of this type of crime. Most of them will choose a place with a lot of people. At least a lot of people means a higher chance of forgetting to pull out the card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the behavior of taking money while the owner is negligent seems very simple, even pure, but there are great differences in the characterization of this behavior in the academic circles. There are two main points of view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Anyone who withdraws money from an ATM without asking the source of the card should be considered the crime of theft; 2. The act of picking up another person&amp;rsquo;s credit card and using it on an automatic teller machine (ATM) falls under the circumstance of &amp;ldquo;fraudulently using another person&amp;rsquo;s credit card&amp;rdquo; as stipulated in Item (3) of Paragraph 1 of Article 196 of the Criminal Law, which constitutes a crime. Pursue criminal responsibility for credit card fraud.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first point of view is represented by Professor Zhang Mingkai of Tsinghua University:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;       In such cases, we cannot simply understand the provisions of Article 196 of the Criminal Law, and we should not only look at the fraudulent use of other people&amp;rsquo;s credit cards or the use of counterfeit credit cards, but should combine the elements of &amp;ldquo;conducting credit card fraud activities&amp;rdquo; in this article, that is, It must be that the victim has a misunderstanding and disposes of property based on the misunderstanding, otherwise it cannot be called &amp;ldquo;cheating&amp;rdquo;. Assuming that the criminal law does not stipulate the crime of fraud, fraud is the indirect principal offender of theft. Therefore, the crime of fraud must be to deceive a natural person, and it is impossible for an ATM to be deceived. There is no dispute about this in countries with civil law systems or countries with common law systems. For example, both Germany and Japan stipulate the crime of &amp;ldquo;using computer fraud&amp;rdquo;, which essentially refers to theft of property interests. The perpetrator hacked into the computer terminal of the bank&amp;rsquo;s computer, transferred the victim&amp;rsquo;s bank deposits into his own passbook, and did not withdraw the money. In our country, it must be convicted of theft, but in Germany and Japan, the crime of theft cannot be convicted, because the two In China, the crime of theft is limited to property, and only fraud includes property interests. Why can&amp;rsquo;t the object of the crime of theft be expanded to property interests? Because there is no starting point for their property crimes, if property interests are used as the object of the theft crime, it will cause confusion. For example, staying in someone’s air-conditioned room without authorization for two minutes may constitute the crime of theft. Lecture attendance may also constitute the crime of theft. Moreover, &amp;ldquo;the crime of using computers to defraud&amp;rdquo; is not a crime of fraud, because it is impossible for the cash machine to be deceived, and it is impossible for the cash machine to make a mistake. As long as it complies with the withdrawal procedure and enters the correct password, the cash machine will operate as usual regardless of whether the cash drawer is the cardholder or not. Work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It believes that the reason why credit card fraud is convicted separately is because it has the meaning of &amp;ldquo;fraud&amp;rdquo;. If there is no &amp;ldquo;fraud&amp;rdquo; behavior, it should be positioned as the crime of theft. We can also simply understand Professor Zhang’s point of view: put money in the announcement safe—open the safe—unlock it—the balance is taken away by others—“others” constitute the crime of theft. As for the ATM, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what kind of thing it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;       The key difference between the crime of theft and the crime of fraud is that the crime of theft violates the will of the victim, while the crime of fraud involves the voluntary disposal of property by the victim based on flawed knowledge. As far as this type of case is concerned, since the perpetrator withdraws money from the ATM against the will of the victim, any perpetrator who withdraws money from the ATM without asking the source of the card should be deemed the crime of theft. If you withdraw money on the counter, you need to distinguish between two situations. If you withdraw money on the counter after stealing a credit card, it is the crime of theft; Fraud, because at this time the bank staff had a misunderstanding, thinking that the fraudulent user was the cardholder. There are two points to note here: first, picking up credit cards is an inconsequential act, because picking up without other actions cannot be convicted; second, the damage to property does not lie in picking up, stealing or snatching credit cards, but in how they are used credit card. For example, if the actor picks up the credit card and withdraws 5,000 yuan from the ATM, and then withdraws 5,000 yuan from the counter, it should be determined that the actor has committed the crime of theft and credit card fraud. crime. If the perpetrator withdraws money directly from an ATM while others forget to take out the card, he should be charged with theft, not embezzlement. Because as long as the money is not taken out, it cannot be regarded as a forgotten thing, because it is in the possession of the bank at this time, and embezzlement is the act of taking the property that one owns as his own; even if he picks up other people&amp;rsquo;s credit cards, the perpetrator only possesses the credit card itself , not the amount on the credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the difference is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reply of the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate on how to characterize the behavior of picking up someone else&amp;rsquo;s credit card and using it on an automatic teller machine (ATM)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Adopted at the 92nd Meeting of the Tenth Procuratorial Committee of the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate on February 19, 2008)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhejiang Provincial People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your hospital&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Request for Instructions on How to Qualify the Behavior of Picking up Other People&amp;rsquo;s Credit Cards and Using It on ATMs&amp;rdquo; (Zhejianyan [2007] No. 227) has been received. After research, the approval is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of picking up another person&amp;rsquo;s credit card and using it on an automatic teller machine (ATM) falls under the circumstance of &amp;ldquo;fraudulently using another person&amp;rsquo;s credit card&amp;rdquo; as stipulated in Item (3) of Paragraph 1 of Article 196 of the Criminal Law, which constitutes a crime and shall be charged with the credit card. Criminal responsibility for fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announcement of the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Reply of the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate on How to Qualify the Behavior of Picking Up Others&amp;rsquo; Credit Cards and Using It on Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs)&amp;rdquo; was passed by the 92nd Meeting of the Tenth Procuratorial Committee of the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate on February 19, 2008 , is hereby promulgated and shall come into force on May 7, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                                      April 18, 2008&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in reality, almost all cases of this kind are sentenced without exception to &amp;ldquo;crime of credit card fraud&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The crime of credit card fraud (Article 196 of the Criminal Law) refers to the act of defrauding large amounts of property by using credit cards for the purpose of illegal possession, in violation of credit card management regulations. ²&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might as well analyze whether the crime of credit card fraud is constituted from the traditional theory of crime constitution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;object of crime&lt;/strong&gt;: This behavior has violated the public and private property ownership of the relevant parties of the bank and credit card and the country&amp;rsquo;s credit card management system;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of the criminal object (the social relationship protected by the criminal law violated by the suspect), the crime of credit card fraud focuses more on the protection of the credit card management system. (But it is true that it is difficult to understand how it jeopardizes the credit card management system in the case of forgetting to take out the card and being withdrawn by someone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;objective elements of crime&lt;/strong&gt;: Fraudulently using someone else&amp;rsquo;s credit card to withdraw money, knowing that the credit card is not your own, but still continuing to conduct transactions with the ATM machine, this is a typical fraudulent use, anyway, except for obtaining the consent of the cardholder, it is all fraudulent use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;subjective aspect&lt;/strong&gt;: Intention to illegally occupy other people&amp;rsquo;s property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The crime of theft (Article 264 of the Criminal Law) refers to the act of secretly stealing a relatively large amount of public and private property for the purpose of illegal possession, or secretly stealing public and private property several times.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of the crime of theft, the object of the violation is the ownership of public and private property, which objectively shows the behavior of secretly stealing public and private property (no one voluntarily surrenders property based on being deceived, and ATM, which cannot be used as a tool for being deceived, is not available. &amp;ldquo;Person&amp;rdquo;), and subjectively and intentionally illegally occupy other people&amp;rsquo;s property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this very simple act can be evaluated in two different ways in the field of criminal law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think both conclusions are very convincing, and it is reasonable for academic circles and judicial practice to adopt one method each. The theory of &amp;ldquo;theft&amp;rdquo; adopted by the academic circle is more in line with the objective reality and the development direction of the criminal law, while the &amp;ldquo;credit card fraud&amp;rdquo; adopted in judicial practice is more based on the &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; itself and according to the actual social situation (the starting point of the crime of theft) is too low, and there are many occurrences of such events that are not particularly harmful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/discussion-on-the-defects-of-death-respite-system/images/nirbhaya-death-penalty-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post Discussion on the Defects of  Death Respite System" /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;The system of suspended execution of death penalty is an original penalty execution system created by New China. It has played an important role in restricting the actual execution of death penalty in the history of our country. There are many flaws in the death reprieve system, which lacks scientificity, rationality and fairness. The article lists and expounds seven defects of the death reprieve system, and believes that these defects must be improved for the continued existence of the death reprieve system in our country.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 48 of my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; stipulates:“For criminals who should be sentenced to death, if it is not necessary to execute immediately, they can be sentenced to death with a two-year suspension of execution.“This article is my country&amp;rsquo;s death penalty suspension system, referred to as death penalty reprieve, and death penalty reprieve is not an independent penalty, but a system for the application of death penalty. At the same time, Article 50 of my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; also stipulates that for criminals who have been sentenced to death with a reprieve, there are three ways to deal with them after the execution period of the reprieve expires:“If a death sentence is suspended, during the period of suspension of execution, if there is no intentional crime,After the expiration of the two-year period, it shall be commuted to life imprisonment; if there are indeed major meritorious service performances, it shall be reduced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 15 years but not more than 20 years after the expiration of the two-year period; if it is found to be true for an intentional crime, it shall be approved by the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Court execution.“The provisions of the &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; on the death reprieve system are limited to this, but the above-mentioned provisions do have many defects. According to the basic principle of legally prescribed crimes, specific issues should be regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;if-a-person-with-a-reprieve-commits-an-intentional-crime-during-the-period-of-probation-does-the-death-penalty-need-to-expire-after-a-two-year-probationary-period&#34;&gt;If a person with a reprieve commits an intentional crime during the period of probation, does the death penalty need to expire after a two-year probationary period?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been controversy over whether a two-year probationary period is required before executions are carried out. Article 48 of my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; stipulates: &amp;ldquo;The death penalty is only applicable to criminals who have committed extremely serious crimes. For criminals who should be sentenced to death, if they do not have to be executed immediately, they can be sentenced to death with a two-year suspension of execution.&amp;rdquo; Therefore Some scholars believe that the purpose of the legislation is to give reprieve offenders a road to rehabilitation, and this requires a comprehensive examination of the performance of reprieve offenders during the two-year probation period. If not wait. If the death penalty is executed without waiting for the expiration of the two-year period, it is suspected of violating the legislative purpose of the death reprieve system. Another point of view is that the two-year reprieve is conditional. If the reprieve still refuses to repent and the intentional crime is verified to be true, the death penalty should be approved, not necessarily after the two-year period expires. There is also a view that the time limit for changing the death sentence from a reprieve to an immediate execution of the death penalty should be treated in a specific case. According to the suspended death sentence, if the crime committed by the offender during the probation period should be executed immediately, there is no need to wait for the expiration of the two-year period; The death penalty shall not be carried out. The author agrees with the third point of view, that criminals with reprieve should be treated differently for their intentional crimes during the probation period: on the one hand, for criminals who should be executed immediately during the probation period, the death penalty can be executed without waiting for two years after approval; On the one hand, for those who have committed other crimes during the probation period, the death penalty will not be executed until the expiration of two years. Although from an objective point of view, among the criminals with reprieve who committed crimes other than the immediate execution of the death penalty, there are many criminals who are subjectively vicious and have no sincerity in reforming themselves. The purpose is to determine a certain time limit and give criminals a chance to reform themselves, and within this statutory period, the criminal enforcement agency will conduct a comprehensive inspection of criminals. This time limit should be established by the legislator based on some reasonable basis, and cannot be shortened or extended at will, otherwise the two-year reprieve system itself is flawed and should not be set in the death reprieve system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-deal-with-the-death-reprieve-inmate-who-commits-an-intentional-crime-after-performing-major-meritorious-service-during-the-suspension-period&#34;&gt;How to deal with the death reprieve inmate who commits an intentional crime after performing major meritorious service during the suspension period
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the provisions of Article 210, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law and Article 50 of the Criminal Law, during the period of suspension of execution, if a prisoner with a reprieve does perform major meritorious service, after the expiration of the two-year period, the number of years shall be reduced to not less than 15 but not more than 20 years. Fixed-term imprisonment; if an intentional crime is found to be true, the death penalty shall be executed. However, there is no provision in the current law on how to deal with a person with a reprieve who first performs major meritorious service and then commits an intentional crime during the reprieve period. Regarding this issue, some scholars believe that a choice in favor of the criminal should be made, that is, the death penalty should not be executed; however, since the criminal commits a crime intentionally while performing major meritorious service, the sentence should be reduced to life imprisonment. Scholars also believe that crimes can be divided intoSerious intentional crimes that should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment, etc., and different treatment for reprieved criminals according to the degree of major meritorious service. The author believes that intentional crime and major meritorious service are two different concepts, which lack comparability and are difficult to judge and compare in practice. Moreover, major meritorious services are the circumstances of sentencing or commutation of sentences, which have no impact on the determination of intentional crimes. It lacks legal basis, scientificity and rationality to offset the legal consequences of intentional crimes. In this case, because it does not comply with the provisions of commutation to fixed-term imprisonment for major meritorious service, it does not meet the provisions of executing the death penalty for intentionally committed crimes, and it does not meet the requirements for commuting to life imprisonment for those without intentional crimes. Provisions. In the absence of a legal basis in the current law, it is up to the legislature to amend the legislation or at least make a legislative interpretation to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-deal-with-the-death-reprieve-criminal-who-commits-an-intentional-crime-and-then-performs-major-meritorious-service-during-the-suspension-period&#34;&gt;How to deal with the death reprieve criminal who commits an intentional crime and then performs major meritorious service during the suspension period
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;my country&amp;rsquo;s penal regulations stipulate that if a prisoner with reprieve commits an intentional crime during the period of reprieve, the death penalty shall be executed in accordance with the penalty and verified to be true. If the death penalty is carried out without waiting for the two-year period to expire if some scholars believe that there is an intentional crime during the period of probation, then it is obviously impossible to reasonably deal with the emergence of such a situation. Some scholars believe that after the expiration of the two-year probation period, the intentional crimes and major meritorious services within two years can be fully liquidated, and the merits and demerits can be balanced to obtain the final verdict of approving the death penalty or commuting to other penalties. However, if the final result is not to approve the death penalty: because major meritorious service performance should become the sentencing circumstances of intentional crimes, and the sentencing circumstances can only be applied once, so as to compensate for the immediate execution of the death penalty, it will be applied twice, which is obviously not allowed , is also unfair and unreasonable. The author believes that for criminals who committed both intentional crimes and major meritorious service during the suspension of execution of the death sentence, we can comprehensively examine the benefits brought by their meritorious service to the country and society, as well as the degree of personal danger reduction reflected by repentance, and analyze The proportion between &amp;ldquo;sin&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;atonement&amp;rdquo; among them will be analyzed in detail. but currently noWhen amending legislation or making corresponding legislative interpretations, this approach cannot rule out the opportunity for very few criminals to commit intentional crimes: they hold clues to major meritorious service, deliberately refuse to report it, but use it to commit intentional crimes, Afterwards, it was reported to confirm the performance of major crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-deal-with-the-general-meritorious-deeds-of-prisoners-on-death-reprieve-during-the-period-of-suspension&#34;&gt;How to deal with the general meritorious deeds of prisoners on death reprieve during the period of suspension
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since our country&amp;rsquo;s criminal law only stipulates the major meritorious service performed by the death penalty during the suspension period, in judicial practice, this situation has been incorporated into &amp;ldquo;During the suspension period, if there is no intentional crime, after the two-year period expires commuted to life imprisonment&amp;rdquo;. Does it seem unfair that those who have performed meritorious service are treated the same as those who have not committed crimes intentionally? Does the reformation of criminals during the period of reprieve seem less active? However, for general meritorious service, the clauses with major meritorious service cannot be directly applied, so it seems that it is very necessary to deal with the situation of general meritorious service during the suspension of execution. Some scholars suggest that during the period of suspension of execution of the death sentence, if there is indeed meritorious service, it is verified that the sentence is commuted to life imprisonment without waiting for two years. The author believes that any criminal with a suspended death sentence who has performed meritorious service, even if it is not a major meritorious service, is enough to show that the criminal has repented to a large extent and has rehabilitated himself. Such behavior should be used as a legal evaluation during the test period and have an impact on the final result. . Of course, this can only be achieved if the legislature of our country should make overall legislative amendments or at least legislative interpretations on the &amp;ldquo;no intentional crime and no meritorious service&amp;rdquo;, meritorious service and major meritorious service performance of death reprieve criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-deal-with-the-death-reprieve-criminal-who-intentionally-commits-a-crime-during-the-suspension-period-but-the-circumstances-are-minor&#34;&gt;How to deal with the death reprieve criminal who intentionally commits a crime during the suspension period but the circumstances are minor
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article 50 of my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; stipulates that if a prisoner with reprieve commits an intentional crime during the period of reprieve, and it is verified that it is true, the death penalty shall be executed. This shows that the condition for approving the execution of the death penalty with a reprieve is that the criminal commits an intentional crime during the two-year reprieve. The criminal law does not limit the scope of intentional crimes, which means that as long as criminals commit intentional crimes within a period of two years, no matter what kind of intentional crimes they commit, whether they are direct intentional or indirect intentional, and whether the intentional crimes they commit are The state of completion, or the preparation, attempt, or suspension of the incomplete state does not affect the approval of execution of the death penalty. In this regard, some scholars believe that it is unfair to regard intentional crime as a condition for the execution of the death penalty. It believes that since the crimes committed by the criminals before the reprieve sentence have reached the level of the death penalty, they have not been executed, but the intentional crimes committed during the reprieve period have not reached the level of the death penalty but will be executed. The death penalty is clearly unfair. Some scholars also believe that in my country&amp;rsquo;s criminal law, since the scope of intentional crimes is very wide, and in judicial practice, the criminal circumstances of various intentional crimes are also very different, and the corresponding criminal responsibilities are also divided into degrees of severity. All intentional crimes committed during the execution period will be executed, which may violate the original intention of the Criminal Law and the Criminal Procedure Law to amend the conditions for execution of the death penalty during the suspended execution period. The author believes that, since Article 5 of my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; stipulates: &amp;ldquo;The severity of the penalty shall be commensurate with the crimes committed by the criminals and the criminal responsibilities they bear.&amp;rdquo; Criminal responsibility, and if the crime committed is serious, it should bear heavy criminal responsibility. This is also one of the three basic principles stipulated in my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;principle of commensurate crime and punishment&amp;rdquo;. However, during the reprieve period, if criminals commit subjectively intentional crimes, regardless of the seriousness of the crime, they will all be executed, which obviously violates the principle of adapting crime to punishment, and makes an exception to the principle of adapting crime to punishment in the criminal law. , which is obviously not allowed, nor should it be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the author believes that during the period of reprieve, if the intentional crime is minor and does not need to be sentenced to a penalty or can be exempted from the penalty according to the provisions of the Criminal Law, it should be attributed to the death sentence when the sentence of reprieve is determined.“does not have to be done immediately“situation. If the execution of the death penalty is still carried out on the criminals with reprieve under such circumstances, it will not only violate the original intention of establishing the death penalty system in our country&amp;rsquo;s criminal law, but also fail to realize the function of the death penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-deal-with-criminals-found-to-have-missed-crimes-during-the-period-of-suspension-of-execution-and-after-the-implementation-of-the-change&#34;&gt;How to deal with criminals found to have missed crimes during the period of suspension of execution and after the implementation of the change
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; does not stipulate how to deal with a reprieved prisoner who is found to have other crimes that have not been sentenced during the reprieve test. At this time, should the reprieve be revoked and the reprieve executed for several crimes be punished together, or should the sentence be changed to the death sentence and executed immediately? Some scholars believe that for the missed crimes discovered during the suspension of execution of the death sentence, the provisions of Article 70 of the &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; can be referred to to make a judgment on the newly discovered crime, and then the punishment for the subsequent crime and the execution of the suspended death sentence should be combined. Decide on the penalty to be imposed. The author believes that for the omissions found during the probation period, they should be executed together. In this case, there are two results of concurrent punishment, the decision to execute the death penalty with a reprieve and the decision to execute the death penalty immediately. It depends on the degree of the crime of omission: if the crime of omission should be sentenced to death penalty with immediate execution, then it should be sentenced to execution with suspension of death penalty and the final decision should be immediate execution of death penalty; Concurrent punishment for execution should generally continue to be executed with a suspended sentence of execution; even if the omission of a crime should be sentenced to death with a suspended execution, the combined execution can only be executed with a suspended death sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current laws and judicial interpretations of our country do not involve how to deal with the case where a death reprieve commits an intentional crime during the period of reprieve, but is discovered after the two-year period has expired and the sentence has been commuted, and the statute of limitations for prosecution has not expired. However, in judicial practice, some intentional crimes committed by inmates with reprieve during the period of probation, such as theft in prisons, are generally concealed, and are often not discovered during the two-year probation period of the probation. It was discovered after being commuted to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment, and the intentional crime committed again has not exceeded the limitation period for prosecution. Regarding the handling of this situation, some scholars believe: &amp;ldquo;Although the &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Criminal Procedure Law&amp;rdquo; only stipulate that a person with a reprieve who commits an intentional crime during the period of suspension of execution shall be executed, there is no regulation on when the intentional crime is discovered. However, The death penalty has been commuted and the sentence determined after the commutation is being executed. Therefore, based on the principle of benefiting the defendant, the death penalty should not be executed on the criminal at this time, and a judgment should be made for the newly discovered crime. Implementing combined punishment for several crimes determines the penalty to be executed by the criminal.” The author agrees with this point of view, and at the same time, this issue should also be discussed in two situations. It is necessary to distinguish the time when the omission of crime is discovered after the probation period expires, and the commutation ruling has not yet been made. What was discovered before was that after the probationary period expired, the omission of crime was discovered only after the commutation ruling was made. If the new crime is discovered after the probation period has expired and before the commutation ruling is made, after the new crime is verified to be true, the execution of the death penalty shall be changed for the reprieved criminal. The reason is that at this time the commutation ruling has not yet been made, and the reprieve has not yet been finally changed. After the new crime is verified to be true, the death penalty should be changed for the reprieved criminal. And if the new crime is discovered after the commutation ruling is made, the death penalty should not be changed to the reprieved prisoner. The reason is that the commutation ruling has been made at this time, and the reprieve has been changed to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment. Based on the stability of the law and the principle of benefiting criminals, the execution of the death sentence should not be changed to the reprieve, but should be executed with the new crime after the judgment is made. The sentence being executed shall be punished in combination in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Law, and the sentence to be executed shall be determined as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;during-the-period-of-reprieve-the-reprieve-commits-crimes-that-are-dealt-with-only-after-being-informed-and-how-to-deal-with-those-who-have-not-been-informed&#34;&gt;During the period of reprieve, the reprieve commits crimes that are dealt with only after being informed, and how to deal with those who have not been informed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article 50 of my country&amp;rsquo;s Criminal Law stipulates that if a person with a reprieve commits an intentional crime and it is verified that it is true, the death penalty shall be executed. However, the criminal law does not clarify whether the &amp;ldquo;intentional crime&amp;rdquo; includes crimes that are dealt with only after notification. In view of the fact that the death penalty commits a crime that is dealt with only after being informed during the execution of the suspended sentence, but the victim did not tell, and there is no situation where &amp;ldquo;the victim cannot tell due to coercion and intimidation&amp;rdquo;, some scholars believe that if the death penalty is executed, then the judiciary will take the initiative. Ascertaining the facts of this crime is &amp;ldquo;contrary to the establishment purpose of the crime that is dealt with only after being informed.&amp;rdquo; The author believes that it is reasonable to exclude the crime that is dealt with only after being informed, because in this case, if the victim does not tell, the judiciary will not be able to Will not take the initiative to prosecute, the perpetrator will not be held criminally responsible. Moreover, crimes dealt with only after being informed are excluded, which is in line with the purpose of the death reprieve system: the modern death reprieve system &amp;ldquo;is the embodiment of the penalty concept of &amp;lsquo;use the death penalty with caution&amp;rsquo; and is established under the guidance of the modern penalty purpose of &amp;lsquo;combining punishment and education&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; up system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system of reprieve is a very effective way of execution of death penalty created by my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo;, which can not only retain the deterrent effect of death penalty, but also effectively reduce the actual application of death penalty. Currently restricting and abolishing the death penalty has become an irreversible trend in the world. Since our country does not yet have the historical and realistic conditions for abolishing the death penalty and immediately executing it, we should give full play to the effectiveness of the death penalty system and use it as a reasonable choice for restricting the death penalty at this stage. However, in view of the various defects and imperfections of the death reprieve system, the author believes that the reform of the death reprieve system is imperative, or at leastIt is up to the legislature to amend the legislation or at least make legislative interpretations to address the many deficiencies in the death reprieve system,Only in this way can this penal system with Chinese characteristics be implemented more stably.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-blog-history&#34;&gt;The Blog History
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The startup period&lt;/strong&gt; began in 2008 when, at the recommendation of a friend, I moved my blog from Niuboo to the WordPress platform, thus starting my journey as an independent blogger. During this time, I mainly posted reflections on college life and learning experiences. However, due to my more left-leaning thoughts during my student days, much of it is now unreadable, so during one move, most of the content was deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The neglect period&lt;/strong&gt; started when I first entered the workforce. Due to reasons like youthful energy and the &amp;ldquo;capable ones should work more&amp;rdquo; mindset, I rarely updated my blog. I was mainly occupied with trying out different hosting services and platforms. I changed domains and hosts numerous times, and even used &amp;ldquo;Train Head&amp;rdquo; to collect many mindless articles. The number of articles increased, the database grew larger, but the content I wrote myself became less and less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The transformation period&lt;/strong&gt; began in 2014 when domestic internet regulation intensified suddenly. Faced with constant notifications of violating links from Alibaba Cloud, I found it unbearable. Many common words and phrases were deemed inappropriate, leaving me at a loss. Combined with the unstable access to Wordpress.org, I decided to migrate my blog to Typecho and make it entirely English. However, since domestic internet bandwidth was still limited at the time, and I often saw friends&amp;rsquo; domains turning &amp;ldquo;yellow,&amp;rdquo; I decided to keep the hosting on Alibaba Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The relocation period&lt;/strong&gt; was around 2016. After transitioning to an English blog, my English proficiency was still limited, so I just casually posted images and wrote a few sentences as updates, without caring about the number of visitors. After all, Google PR ranking was canceled in 2016, the mobile internet was on the rise, and few people continued to visit web pages. I considered maintaining a 1ip blog just as a keepsake, so I started experimenting with free foreign hosting spaces. To adapt to the small database limits of the free space, I deleted another batch of previous fragmented content and some irrelevant stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reconstruction period&lt;/strong&gt; followed the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. With more personal leisure time, and introduced by a friend, I joined the MJJ ranks and became more and more involved in blogging. At its peak, I had a bunch of various low-cost VPS. I would just randomly pick a VPS to host the blog without much management. During this period, I also tried multiple solutions like Hexo Hugo, but I ended up just tinkering with the website framework itself and neglecting writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The finalization period&lt;/strong&gt; came in 2023, when I was approaching 35 years old, an age when people in many industries start thinking about retirement. I restructured the blog, thinking that this would be the final form to play with, and I was too lazy to tinker with the website itself anymore. Currently, it&amp;rsquo;s divided into two parts: one is an English blog as the main publication platform, using my daughter&amp;rsquo;s name as the domain, hoping to bring some inspiration to her future life and learning experiences; the other in github page, using my university&amp;rsquo;s name as the domain, where I synchronize and publish some Chinese pages, sort of carrying the idea of more than 10 years of tinkering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dizzy in the afternoon, I stood in front of the bookshelf and spent more than half an hour flipping through Russell&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;China Question&amp;rdquo;, excerpted two pages,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to be convinced by Russell&amp;rsquo;s vision in 1922. Most of the Chinese problems he predicted happened later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And mostly impartial, to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among them are a few comparative viewpoints, which I have known before, and let me deepen my impression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At that time, there was no big gap between China and the West in terms of morality and ethics. The biggest gap between China and the UK was science and technology;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Chinese learn from the West, most of them only care about morality, ethics, social value, etc., and pursue the pleasure of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joy of knowledge is considered by the Chinese as the door to wisdom;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westerners come to China only for three things: fighting wars, making money, and preaching;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of Japanese learning from the West is to enrich the country and strengthen the army;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese think that they are the best nation, and this point of view is shown to the world through the behavior of the Japanese,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the only exception to the &amp;ldquo;white-yellow-black&amp;rdquo; theory of the superiority and inferiority of races;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three major weaknesses of Chinese people: greed, cowardice, and indifference;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fragility of China&amp;rsquo;s coastal defense before the Sino-Japanese War of 1899-1895 was due to the corruption of Japanese interests;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China needs to save itself, not rely on foreigners!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is only a small part of my consciousness. This book still has a very friendly attitude towards China, but it is towards the West,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is more criticized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many historical facts in it are now clear, its predictability is really worth studying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>The spirit of the Dharma</title>

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After roughly reading &amp;ldquo;The Spirit of Laws&amp;rdquo;, it is of course impossible to read the original work. This is a &amp;ldquo;miniature color print&amp;rdquo;, which is actually a &amp;ldquo;obscene color print&amp;rdquo;. (not with pictures)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editor may have put a lot of color pictures on each page because of his good intentions, but in my eyes, these pictures did not play a big role, on the contrary they kept disturbing my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending half the night flipping through this masterpiece, I found that I was so sorry for Montesquieu. However, if many things are placed in the freshman and sophomore year, I will definitely go deeper, but now,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that I don’t have a lot of time, so I can only briefly mention many theoretical things, and try to pick out some valuable viewpoints and extract them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has already been scratched several times with a pencil by the predecessors, but I still persisted and continued to scratch some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mainly read the two volumes &amp;ldquo;Law and Regime&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Relationship between Law and Climate and National Spirit&amp;rdquo;. Most of the other volumes were directly turned page by page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t go into details about Montesquieu and the greatness of this book. Brother Xu said that if he talked about Rousseau, he couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish it in a week. I think it would take longer if he was allowed to talk about Montesquieu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very few perfect people through the ages, but Montesquieu is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the views on China are quite incisive, and even predicted the current problems in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t like to read books, so we didn’t pay much attention to the translation of &amp;ldquo;The Principle of Ten Thousand Laws&amp;rdquo; translated over 107 years ago and &amp;ldquo;Fa Yi&amp;rdquo; translated 96 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is a miracle in itself that such an insightful book could have been written in 1748.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &gt;www.ifosu.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I would like to give special thanks to Zhuozhuo. If he hadn’t sent a last-minute message to provide free hosting space for this website, I would really rent a server from Xinye Online!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, I would also like to thank my friends around me, whether they are brothers and sisters who share thick and thin, or distant friends who have never met. In the future, I will have to rely on everyone&amp;rsquo;s strong support so that I can make better progress! @&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When each sunrise, we start a new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on the initial period, it can be described as both excitement and depression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excitement is that most of the time when you encounter difficulties, you can find answers on Google and Bing;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frustrating thing is that even if I find the answer myself, I don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start. What&amp;rsquo;s more, due to excitement, confusion and depression, IIS5.1 occupied port 80 when dealing with the Apache component of XAMPP, so I uninstalled all system components by mistake, and reinstalled the computer as a result, which took a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning from &amp;ldquo;zero&amp;rdquo; is indeed difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember learning static webpage production, html language, C#, etc. when I was a freshman. I also downloaded tutorials for Invincible PhotoShop in private, but it seems that since the completion of the basic computer course exam, all the knowledge I have learned has been left behind. Haven&amp;rsquo;t felt anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I knew it, it was already four o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning, Brother Gou was still chatting with the girls, and my eyes were already hurting, recalling the time from the night before to now, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but sigh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20% time did 100% things, 80% time did meaningless things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ling Ling finally figured it out, and I have enough detours. For jobs like uploading websites, I first used the method of uploading extracurricular assignments in the computer course taught by teacher Guo Li when I was a freshman. I just click on the entire file Clip upload, but the wordpress installation program has not been uploaded in 40 minutes. Fortunately, I learned that DirectAdmin supports the compressed package in xxx.tar.gz format after being reminded by Wuhu Juanke at this time, which will also save me in the next work It took no less than a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;Never be arrogant in victory and not discouraged in defeat&amp;rdquo; is a more appropriate attitude towards life, but it is a pity that I fell under its skirt again..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems that occurred probably have the following aspects: 1. I don’t know what Mysql is, and I repeatedly make mistakes in filling in the database user, and I continue to find other versions of wp to upload without knowing it; 2. The level of E text is not high, and I don’t know enough about the options in the WP background Thorough, resulting in frequent errors in the settings, and had to reinstall if there were too many errors; 3. Still do not understand E text, set site redirection in DirectAdmin, causing an endless loop of address resolution, and reinstalled in desperation; 4. In the background option, set WordPress with blog They were all changed to the domain name address, resulting in an error on the page. In desperation, I had to continue to reinstall; 5. Unauthorized modification of .htaccess caused an endless loop again, and I had no choice but to reinstall; Upload it, but forget that you only need to upload the Chinese Sinicization plug-in, and then delete all of them&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the last moment, there was still a problem, but the reason was not directly because of myself, but because of an error in downloading the plug-in, which caused the background to completely crash&amp;hellip; (full of garbled characters)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason is that there is an error in the functions.php of EOS under themes (this plug-in was updated today, it is estimated that the author is different from the background program I use), fortunately, I have built xampp locally before, and downloaded and imported an earlier version of the EOS theme , open cutftp, overwrite functions.php, the world is finally peaceful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I want to explain that I am going to build this site as a blog type site for the time being, not only because of my respect and support for Zappao and the WordPress blog sharing plan, but also because I am limited to my level and can only rely on shared resources on the Internet for the time being. To build such a kind of website that is not very technical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing a domain name is a very difficult thing. The reason for choosing ifosu.com is because the abbreviation of my university is FOSU. I will introduce these in detail in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it should be noted that this website temporarily uses the EOS theme recommended by ipack and made by sebastianrs. Due to time constraints, only akismet, Ozh&amp;rsquo; Admin Drop Down Menu and One Click Plugin Updater are installed in the plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After opening the message reply function, you only need to fill in the user name and email address to reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any comments or suggestions, I will try my best to modify them within my ability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
