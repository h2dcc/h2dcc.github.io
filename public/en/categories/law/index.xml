        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/listening-to-the-teachings-of-a-university-professor-again-after-16-years/university.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Listening to the teachings of a university professor again after 16 years" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 13th, the Ministry of Education issued a public notice, indicating its intention to agree to the proposal by Foshan University of Science and Technology to change its name to Foshan University. This is the fifth renaming application by Foshan University of Science and Technology, and it seems that the matter has finally been settled. Initially, at the end of 2019, during the third renaming application to “Guangdong University of Science and Technology,” it seemed almost certain, as the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education had already publicized it and submitted it to the Ministry of Education for approval. However, due to the impact of the pandemic, the renaming inspection originally planned for the spring of 2020 did not proceed as scheduled, and this delay lasted for three years. By 2023, the Ministry of Education had introduced new naming rules for universities, making it almost impossible for Foshan University of Science and Technology to be approved for renaming as Guangdong University of Science and Technology. Consequently, when resubmitting the application, the school proposed the name “Foshan University,” which was actually one of the school’s previous names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-sudden-arrangement-for-a-class-reunion&#34;&gt;A sudden arrangement for a class reunion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a stone stirring up a thousand ripples, the familiar Foshan University was finally returning, reviving the long-silent class and alumni groups. Consequently, a classmate proposed a weekend dinner gathering to celebrate this wonderful event. Due to the sudden nature of the event, only eight classmates nearby Foshan were able to attend, and one person couldn’t make it to the dinner due to a last-minute matter. However, to everyone’s surprise, what started as a joke in the class group ended up with the classmate who organized the event actually inviting the former dean of the college. This respected dean had also taught our “Jurisprudence” course during the 2007-2008 academic year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;listening-to-the-teacher-lecture-again&#34;&gt;Listening to the teacher lecture again
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For almost the first three hours of the dinner, it was mostly the teacher talking, or us students asking questions and the teacher answering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-the-teacher-himself&#34;&gt;About the teacher himself
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teacher started with his experiences of traveling abroad after retiring in January this year and talked about his personal journey from starting to teach at Foshan University in 1992, through its renaming to Foshan University of Science and Technology, and the multiple attempts to revert to a university status. Especially after 2017, he shared his own health challenges and how, as a scholar, he conducted interdisciplinary research on his condition, overcame it, and took care of his health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-childrens-education&#34;&gt;About children’s education
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the dinner, the teacher spent a long time talking about his own experiences and those of other teachers at the college in educating their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;he-emphasized-the-current-importance-of-the-high-school-entrance-exam-zhongkao&#34;&gt;He emphasized the current importance of the high school entrance exam (Zhongkao)
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which he believes is now more significant than the college entrance exam (Gaokao). Since the late 1970s, the Gaokao has been considered the most important exam in China, with countless people relying on it to change their destinies. However, in recent years, due to the saturation of college enrollment, the university admission rate has approached 90%, and for most students attending ordinary high schools, even if they “lie flat,” they basically have no worries about not being able to attend university. Overall, the importance of the Gaokao is decreasing. But at the same time, due to the “general vocational分流” policy, during the process of entering high school, more than 55% of junior high school students in many places can only attend secondary vocational technical schools after graduation, and it is basically impossible for these schools to progress to ordinary universities. In this situation, if a child’s academic performance is not ideal in primary and junior high school, they may lose the opportunity to attend an ordinary university and can only take the vocational technical university route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;he-talked-about-his-methods-of-educating-his-children&#34;&gt;He talked about his methods of educating his children
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both he and his wife are highly educated, but they also faced difficulties in educating their children. He summed it up with the phrase &lt;strong&gt;“parents are not good at teaching their children (academics).”&lt;/strong&gt; Parents can still play a decisive role in their children’s growth in life and other aspects, but their role in learning is very limited. He emphasized the importance of teachers and schools in improving children’s academic performance and cited a series of examples from his surroundings. He hoped that we would create a relaxed family atmosphere for our children, send them to the best schools within our means, and handle relationships with teachers well. He advised that we should mainly rely on schools and classrooms to enhance our children’s learning ability, rather than relying on family or off-campus tutoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;he-discussed-the-issue-of-childrens-educational-planning&#34;&gt;He discussed the issue of children’s educational planning.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a law major himself and with his wife studying medicine, he pointed out that fields like law, especially medicine, and computer science are highly competitive and require continuous learning and updating of knowledge to keep up with the times. Even in computer science, it’s quite possible to be unable to compete with younger people in their thirties and forties due to the physical and familial demands that come with age, making it easy to fall behind in the race for new technology. He stressed the importance of guiding children to develop hobbies and interests based on their personalities and interests, rather than just following trends. The teacher has only one daughter, who is almost our age. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree from a top art academy in China, she pursued a master’s degree at a well-ranked university in the United States, and later, a Ph.D. After completing her doctorate, she became a teacher at a domestic art academy and quickly grew to become one of the youngest professors there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-the-development-of-the-university&#34;&gt;About the development of the university
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the earliest faculty members with a doctoral degree in law at our alma mater, the teacher has long served as the university’s legal advisor and is aware of many secrets behind the school’s development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-development-of-a-university-is-inseparable-from-the-help-of-influential-people&#34;&gt;The development of a university is inseparable from the help of influential people.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the course of the development of Foshan University and later Foshan University of Science and Technology, the support of key figures was indispensable. In the early stages, two mayors of Foshan City, Yu Fei and Lu Ruihua, played significant roles. Without the attention and support of these two mayors, Foshan University would not have been established in 1986. &lt;em&gt;(Yu Fei: Served as the Vice-Governor of Guangdong Province but was expelled from the Communist Party in 1998 due to his children’s seeking private interests; Lu Ruihua: Served as the Governor of Guangdong Province. )&lt;/em&gt;
In the last 10 years, Foshan University of Science and Technology has skyrocketed from outside the top 500 national university rankings to 219th nationwide, thanks in large part to the assistance of the former Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, Hu Chunhua. As a member of the Central Political Bureau, Hu Chunhua visited the school three times after 2015, proposed the goal of building Foshan University of Science and Technology into a high-level science and technology university in Guangdong, and the Guangdong provincial government allocated 500 million yuan specifically for support. Since then, the school’s development has entered the fast lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-development-of-a-university-cannot-be-separated-from-government-support&#34;&gt;The development of a university cannot be separated from government support.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since public universities dominate in China, the development of universities is driven by administrative resources, and the richness of these resources determines the height of university development. Decisive factors include the level of education and the allocation of funds, both of which are decided by administrative organs. As a university founded by the Foshan municipal government, Foshan University has inherent shortcomings because, compared to the financial strength of national or provincial governments, a prefecture-level city like Foshan falls far short. Moreover, although Foshan’s economic output ranks among the top 20 in the country, as an ordinary prefecture-level city in the Pearl River Delta, under the three-tier fiscal structure (about 50% of income goes to the central government, and of the remaining 50% tax, another 50% goes to the province, leaving about 25% actually retained), the financial resources that the Foshan municipal government can dispose of are far less than those of first-tier cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, as well as other sub-provincial cities and general provincial capitals. For example, the fiscal budget expenditure for Foshan University of Science and Technology in 2024 is 1.8 billion yuan, while the fiscal budget expenditure for the Foshan municipal government during the same period is 24 billion yuan, accounting for 7.5% of the total. Nearby universities such as Shenzhen University and Southern University of Science and Technology have fiscal expenditures of over 6 billion yuan, which is an amount that the Foshan city government, with a fiscal budget of 24 billion at the city level, cannot afford. Fortunately, Foshan University of Science and Technology is currently not large in scale, and if calculated by the per-student expenditure on funds, it ranks among the top in Guangdong’s higher education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-development-of-a-university-needs-to-go-with-the-flow&#34;&gt;The development of a university needs to go with the flow.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In discussing the school’s development, the teacher specifically mentioned the construction of doctoral programs, which is one of the two biggest projects the school has undertaken in recent years, the other being the “renaming to a university” project. Currently, there are about 400 universities in China with doctoral programs. Although Foshan University of Science and Technology has seen its ranking climb continuously, the lack of a doctoral program has always been a major concern, and this has even led to the university’s president position being vacant for three years. The main reason is that the Foshan municipal government hopes to find an expert at the “Academician” level to serve as the president, and it is almost impossible to find an Academician willing to be the president of a school without a doctoral program. In this round of applying for a doctoral program, the school has put in a great deal of effort, especially the party committee secretary who has used all his skills to advance the discipline construction, focusing on mechanical engineering, a field he is highly proficient in. As of now, the application for a doctoral program has reached the most critical stage. In the list of Guangdong universities applying for doctoral program construction published by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education, Foshan University of Science and Technology’s mechanical engineering doctoral program ranked first among 234 disciplines in 32 universities across the province, and veterinary and animal husbandry programs also ranked among the top five. It can be said that this is the closest the school has been to securing a doctoral program since it became a doctoral degree-granting institution in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-personal-growth&#34;&gt;About personal growth
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his 32 years of work experience, the teacher shared several key aspects that we should focus on during our professional development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;avoid-speaking-ill-of-others-when-they-are-not-present&#34;&gt;Avoid speaking ill of others when they are not present.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teacher emphasized that Chinese society is heavily influenced by personal relationships, and we should never speak ill of others, regardless of how much we may dislike them or have had conflicts with them. Even a decade ago, we might not have fully appreciated the importance of this advice, but today, we deeply agree with it. Numerous examples around us confirm this point. However, as human beings, we have our limitations, and sometimes we inadvertently express our true feelings, leading to unforeseen consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dont-be-too-rigid&#34;&gt;Don’t be too rigid.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teacher cited several examples from his own experience, advising us to be flexible in handling work relationships and not to be overly pedantic or inflexible. Wearing the necessary masks and disguises is essential for self-protection, which is the foundation of growth. Throughout our development, we will encounter various setbacks and unavoidable conflicts of interest, but we should still approach them with a relaxed and optimistic attitude. Harmonious workplace relationships are crucial for our own well-being. We should not view potential competitors as adversaries but rather as companions, as work is only an eight-hour-a-day matter, while life is a lifelong journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;learn-to-be-content-and-embrace-ordinariness&#34;&gt;Learn to be content and embrace ordinariness.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teacher used examples of students and leaders he has helped and supported over the years to advise us that as we enter middle age, we should start to learn satisfaction and contentment, and not overly concern ourselves with personal gains and losses. After all, as we reach middle age, the harmony of the family, the growth of our children, and our health are often more important than personal advancement. Especially within the system, the time most people can shine in their careers typically does not exceed 15 years. In the marathon of life, there can still be two to three decades after retirement. Even if some have held high positions and had power for a time, facing decades of retirement, if there are problems with the family, children, or their own health, it would all have been in vain.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-legal-work-in-law&#34;&gt;About legal work in law
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a senior law professor, the teacher offered some sound advice and suggestions for the work and development of several of us students based on his own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;regarding-judicial-work&#34;&gt;Regarding judicial work.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including myself, two of us present have worked in judicial authorities. Drawing on his long-term experience serving part-time in the National People’s Congress, the teacher offered two suggestions for those of us engaged in judicial work: First, the current workload in judicial authorities is generally high, with many cases and few people, a situation that is expected to persist for a long time, and the reward may not be proportional to the effort. For women, especially, who often have to invest more in family and childcare, choosing a career in the judiciary requires careful consideration. Second, within the judiciary, there is a significant level of internal competition, with a concentration of highly educated individuals, complex factions, and young and female leaders often having higher aspirations. It is important to know one’s limits, avoid confrontation, and advance steadily with modesty and caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;regarding-arbitration-work&#34;&gt;Regarding arbitration work.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the students present works in an arbitration institution. Based on his experience as an arbitrator, the teacher advised that students working in arbitration institutions should strengthen communication with law firms, businesses, and other industry organizations, improve communication skills, and develop a network of contacts. Outside of work, they should continuously study relevant trade laws, international trade management, and arbitration rules to maintain advanced and in-depth professional knowledge. However, he suggested that it might not be necessary to pursue a doctoral degree, as we have all been working for over a decade and have missed the optimal time to advance our careers with a doctoral degree. Moreover, at our age, with the pressures of work and life, the benefits of obtaining a PhD may not be significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;regarding-notary-work&#34;&gt;Regarding notary work.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two students present work in notary institutions. The teacher, based on his experience, put forward several points: First, the notary industry is relatively closed, with a smaller number of notaries among legal professions, and the overall development space is narrow. Second, in recent years, the notary industry has been continuously promoting restructuring, with some notary institutions transitioning from traditional public institutions to social welfare organizations similar to law firms. In this process, the personal networks and channels established become extremely important, as work income will be directly related to the volume of business. Third, the notary industry is closely related to the legal profession, and it is important to pay attention to interactions with lawyers, guiding clients to resolve many common disputes through notarization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;regarding-lawyer-practice&#34;&gt;Regarding lawyer practice.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One student is a practicing lawyer, and the teacher himself has also served as a part-time lawyer, and I also work part-time as a public service lawyer. Because of concerns that continuing to practice law after retirement might affect retirement benefits, the teacher canceled his part-time lawyer’s license upon retirement and did not apply to convert it to a general lawyer’s practice certificate. The teacher offered several suggestions for legal practice, including the importance of maintaining client relationships, how to expand one’s network and case sources, and the need for lifelong learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;regarding-corporate-work&#34;&gt;Regarding corporate work.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two students work in central enterprises and large private enterprises in the IT and internet industry. As they are both female and have personal or family health issues, the teacher suggested that they should pay attention to their own and their family’s health while maintaining a positive attitude towards life and a proactive learning mindset. They should keep abreast of industry trends and maintain their level of expertise in law, seeking development opportunities through their comparative advantages in non-legal work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;regarding-work-within-the-system&#34;&gt;Regarding work within the system.
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including myself, out of the 7 students present, 5 of us are effectively working in “governmental, institutional, and enterprise units” within the system. The teacher offered a lot of opinions and suggestions on working within the system, also sharing many of his observations from working in the local system in Foshan. As some of the content is sensitive, it has not been written out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;epilogue&#34;&gt;Epilogue
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gathering was indeed a rare opportunity. We arrived at 4 pm in the afternoon, and while waiting for the teacher and other classmates to arrive, we played the card game “Guan Dang” (Gentlemen’s Agreement) as we chatted, with one of our classmates working at a central enterprise saying, “It’s like not eating at all if you don’t play ‘Guan Dang’.” During the meal, we listened to the teacher “lecture” almost throughout, and the teacher even specifically commented on the phenomenon of “Guan Dang.” After the teacher left early due to time constraints, we chatted informally until almost 11 pm before dispersing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;there-is-no-template-for-choosing-the-path-of-life&#34;&gt;There is no template for choosing the path of life
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eight classmates who attended the reunion had all graduated from the same class but later embarked on completely different paths in life. If we extend this group to the entire class of over 40 students, their paths become even more diverse and complex. In general, however, we all stood at the same starting point at the same time, seeking different lives. The vast differences that followed may have been more related to each family’s and personal choices. Even among those who pursued the same profession, different classmates took different paths. For example, in our class, four students became ordinary lawyers, one of whom has been practicing law in Foshan for 13 years and has had a smooth career development; another student who did not attend the dinner began practicing law only 10 years after graduation and is still in the early stages; one student who practices law in Shenzhen opened their own law firm early on and has recently opened branches in other places; and another student who practices law in Chengdu pursued a master’s degree after graduation and initially chose to practice in Shenzhen before moving to Chengdu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-advantage-brought-by-information-gaps-is-gradually-decreasing&#34;&gt;The advantage brought by information gaps is gradually decreasing
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we graduated, information gaps were still a significant factor contributing to differences in life paths. Back then, in our class of over 40 students, only a few chose to take the civil service exam or participate in campus recruitment by enterprises and institutions, and only a few decided to become lawyers. It was only after entering the workforce that more people gradually realized the importance of their undergraduate degree in law. Including myself, many of us entered judicial and administrative organs through the civil service exam in the following years. It was not until 2017, when short video platforms began to thrive, that the advantages of employment in systems such as government agencies and state-owned enterprises were fully exposed, and this was only gradually recognized by the public. At this point, the difficulty of entering these professions compared to when we graduated from university had become unimaginable. For example, when I applied for a civil service position in the Pearl River Delta, there were only 13 applicants for the same position, with only 8 actually taking the exam. With no preparation at all, I even didn’t complete a complete practice test, and yet I managed to score 110 points (out of a total of 200 for two subjects) to become the first-ranked candidate, and was successfully employed. Every time I think back, I feel extremely lucky, with more luck than actual ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;there-are-no-shortcuts-in-the-marathon-of-life&#34;&gt;There are no shortcuts in the marathon of life
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teacher used his rich personal experiences and insights to illustrate how individuals navigate this era. In the 1980s, when university students were still a “rare species,” the teacher, with his strong character and self-discipline, successfully enrolled in university and pursued a master’s degree. He then went south to Foshan University to pioneer, gradually advancing from lecturer to associate professor and then to professor, and serving as the dean of the college. Along the way, he pursued a doctoral degree and engaged in postdoctoral research at top universities in the industry, providing himself and his family with ample material and spiritual wealth. In the second century of struggle, in this era widely considered highly competitive, I believe that this era still offers opportunities for many to change their destinies. However, success can only be achieved through even greater effort, a more positive attitude, and unwavering perseverance. After all, the negative emotions of this era are already enough, with voices of “lying flat” and “tittytainment” products ubiquitous. Only by adhering to one’s original aspiration can one live up to oneself, one’s family, and this era.&lt;/p&gt;

The plaintiff in the case is a company management company in Guangdong (Company A), and the defendant is Ms. Ou. The case is a labor contract dispute.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1basic-case-summary&#34;&gt;1.Basic Case Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Ou is a financial employee of Company A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2018, Ms. Ou was employed by Company A as a middle-level economist, but there was no agreement in their labor contract that Ms. Ou was in a management position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On April 9, 2019, Company A sent Ms. Ou a “Notice of Retirement,” informing her that she would reach the legal retirement age on April 10, 2019, and notifying her to handle retirement procedures and complete work handover within the specified period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On April 10, 2019, Ms. Ou turned 50 years old. She believed that during her working period, she had obtained the professional qualifications of a junior accountant and a middle-level economist, and enjoyed the treatment of professional title subsidy, so she should be classified as a female cadre. Therefore, she applied to Company A to choose to retire at 55 years old. After inquiring with relevant departments, Company A believed that she had reached the legal retirement age and sent her another “Notice of Retirement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From April 1, 2019, to July 1, 2022, Ms. Ou repeatedly filed applications through labor arbitration, social security fund management, human resources and social security authorities, etc., to clarify her retirement age, but was rejected multiple times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 11, 2022, the Human Resources and Social Security Authority issued a “Notice of Retirement Age Clarification,” confirming that Ms. Ou is a female employee engaged in a professional and technical position and can retire at the cadre age of 55. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After negotiations between Company A and Ms. Ou, she returned to her position on September 1, 2022. After returning to her position, Ms. Ou applied for labor arbitration with Company A as the respondent, requesting confirmation that the labor relationship between the two parties still existed from May 2019 to August 2022, and requesting the payment of 310,000 yuan in wages from May 2019 to August 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 6, 2022, the Labor Arbitration Commission made a ruling in accordance with the law; Ms. Ou was dissatisfied with the arbitration ruling regarding the payment of wages and appealed to the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2handling-results&#34;&gt;2.Handling Results
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 6, 2022, the Labor Arbitration Commission made a ruling: confirming that the labor relationship between the two parties still existed from May 2019 to August 2022, and reimbursing the wages for that period amounting to 70,000 yuan due to the fact that no labor was provided during that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Ou appealed to the court because she was not satisfied with the determination of the amount of wages to be reimbursed in the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 2, 2023, the court made a judgment: confirming that the labor relationship between the two parties still existed from May 2019 to August 2022, and reimbursing the wages for that period amounting to 70,000 yuan due to the fact that no labor was provided during that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court’s judgment was consistent with the arbitration commission’s ruling: given that Ms. Ou did not provide any labor from May 2019 to August 2022, it was determined that her wages for that period should be calculated based on the minimum wage standard of Foshan City. Company A reduced the amount of wages to be reimbursed by 240,000 yuan.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3case-insights&#34;&gt;3.Case Insights
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, Company A actively and legally responded to the handling of the case. After the dispute arose, Company A sent several letters to relevant departments to determine Ms. Ou’s retirement age but was unable to confirm her retirement age only because it did not receive a clear response; at the same time, given its active and legal response, it provided some factual basis for the arbitration commission and the court to discretionarily order Company A to calculate Ms. Ou’s wages from May 2019 to August 2022 based on the minimum wage standard of Foshan City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the process of handling the issue of workers’ retirement age, in addition to clearly stipulating in the labor contract that the worker’s position belongs to a “management position,” it is also necessary to comprehensively determine whether the worker’s position belongs to a “professional technical position.” In cases similar to Company A in this case, it is advisable to follow procedures to notify workers of retirement, consult with relevant departments, and retain relevant evidence to prove that the employer actively handles related issues during the worker’s status being undetermined, in order to obtain discretionary handling by the court and actively communicate with workers after receiving a response, properly handle the relationship between the employer and the worker, and standardize management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4research-insights&#34;&gt;4.Research insights
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the aging of our population deepens, labor disputes arising from employee retirement are increasing. This case suggests that before handling employee retirement matters, enterprises should communicate and negotiate fully with employees, respect their right to choose their retirement age, ensure that both parties have a clear understanding and consensus on retirement matters, and avoid unilateral decision-making. Additionally, in the daily personnel management process, enterprises can conduct legal risk assessments in advance regarding the issue of employee retirement age, take corresponding legal measures to prevent and resolve legal issues related to retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/how-to-legally-terminate-an-employment-contract-in-china/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-legally-terminate-an-employment-contract-in-china/images/legal.webp" alt="Featured image of post How to Legally Terminate an Employment Contract in China" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a typical case of legally terminating an employment contract, where the plaintiff is Company A from Foshan City, and the defendant is Mr. Deng. The case revolves around a labor contract dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic facts of the case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2018, Company A (engaged in concrete business) appointed Mr. Deng as the technical director. In 2020, Mr. Deng purchased concrete from Company A for his own housing construction, but the company’s system showed that the parameters of the concrete supplied to Mr. Deng (which were for high-grade concrete) were higher than the standards of the concrete he purchased (Mr. Deng bought low-grade concrete). In November 2021, Mr. Deng fell while descending a staircase at Company A and was injured while on a phone call with a colleague discussing work tasks, fracturing his right foot. In January 2022, Mr. Deng’s injury was recognized as a work-related injury. In April 2022, Mr. Deng printed out his salary records and discussed them with others, violating the confidentiality clause in the Employee Handbook, and Company A gave Mr. Deng a Class B work negligence penalty. In April 2022, an outsider reported Mr. Deng’s abnormal concrete purchase data to Company A, and the company informed Mr. Deng of the report and had several discussions with him, but Mr. Deng failed to provide a reasonable explanation for the data anomaly. In May 2022, a local housing construction authority inspection team conducted a special inspection at Company A and found some serious issues, placing the company under key monitoring. Among these issues, such as incomplete inspection materials, test results not meeting standard requirements, and raw materials lacking calibration records, fell under the responsibility of the technical department led by Mr. Deng. Company A again gave Mr. Deng a Class B work negligence penalty. On May 31, 2022, after notifying the company’s labor union, Company A issued Mr. Deng a “Notice of Termination of Employment Contract,” stating that according to the Employee Handbook, the company could terminate the employment contract immediately if an employee received two Class B penalties within a year. Mr. Deng later filed for labor arbitration, requesting that Company A pay for work injury insurance benefits and compensation for the illegal termination of the employment contract. Company A appealed the arbitration decision to the court.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disposition of the Case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon review, the court determined that Company A should pay Mr. Deng work injury insurance benefits but was not required to pay compensation for the illegal termination of the employment contract. Mr. Deng, dissatisfied with the ruling, filed an appeal. The higher court rejected the appeal and upheld the original judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revelation of the case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons from the Case Constructing harmonious labor-capital relations is an important issue that must be addressed for the long-term and stable development of a company. This case is a typical labor dispute case, involving two common issues in labor disputes: one is the issue of work injury compensation, and the other is the issue of economic compensation for the termination of employment relations. The judgment in this case protects the legitimate rights and interests of employees with work injuries, clarifying the legal responsibility of the employer to pay work injury insurance benefits. On the other hand, in cases where a worker seriously violates company rules and regulations, the employer can terminate the employment relationship through legal procedures without paying economic compensation to the worker. It is important to note that when an employer formulates or modifies rules and regulations that directly affect the vital interests of workers, or when dealing with significant matters, it should discuss these with the employee representative congress or all employees and inform the workers of the rules and regulations. If the employer fails to inform the workers of the rules and regulations, these cannot be used as a basis for determining the rights and obligations of both parties. An employer with a trade union organization that unilaterally terminates an employment contract should notify the union of the reasons in advance. If the union is not notified in advance, and the worker requests economic compensation from the employer for illegally terminating the employment contract, the court should support the worker. In this case, the concrete company submitted evidence such as meeting notices, training confirmation records, public notice photos, and WeChat chat records, confirming that the Employee Handbook was agreed upon by the company’s union and acknowledged by the employees, and was publicly announced to all employees. Therefore, the court recognized that the Employee Handbook was binding on Mr. Deng. The concrete company also submitted a letter notifying the union of the termination of the employment contract, so the court confirmed that the procedures for terminating the employment contract by Company A were legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case has guiding, exemplary, and referential significance for promoting enterprises to hire workers in accordance with the law, reducing labor disputes, and maintaining legitimate employment autonomy. It promotes the core socialist values of respecting one’s position and loving one’s profession, gives a negative evaluation to the worker’s violation of professional ethics and damage to the company’s interests, and upholds the employer’s legitimate right to hire and fire, helping to create a first-class business environment and achieving a good judicial outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research Insights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In labor dispute cases, illegally terminating employment contracts is a perennial problem for many small and medium-sized enterprises. Some companies, when terminating employment contracts due to employees’ serious violations of company rules and regulations, often end up having to pay compensation for illegal termination because of their own inadequate personnel compliance systems. In this case, the fact that the company involved legally established a trade union and issued the “Employee Handbook” following legal procedures was the fundamental prerequisite for legally terminating the employee’s contract. This has typical exemplary significance for promoting the construction of enterprise personnel compliance systems.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-prevent-sexual-abuse-of-minors-with-intellectual-disabilities/images/1.webp" alt="Featured image of post How to prevent sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the issue of the prevention of sexual assault of minors has received extensive attention, including the promulgation of a series of laws and regulations such as the Law on the Protection of Minors and the Regulations on the Protection of Minors in Schools, all of which emphasize the need to strengthen the prevention of sexual assault of minors. However, in general, most of the above-mentioned prevention work is concentrated in schools, and there is not much mention of the problem of sexual assault of minors at the social level, especially between families and neighbors, and a large proportion of sexual assault of minors with intellectual disabilities occurs between families and neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-shocking-cases&#34;&gt;1. Shocking cases
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple search on the Internet is not difficult to find that cases of minors being sexually assaulted at home are not uncommon. Here are a few typical cases as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A case of a 9-year-old girl being sexually assaulted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unfortunate incident of a 9-year-old girl in Guangzhou who was sexually assaulted by a neighbor for 3 years and whose parents did not know about it has recently attracted the attention of readers. At present, the suspect of sexually assaulting the girl is being detained on suspicion of child molestation, and the lawyer said that the suspect can be sentenced to more than 10 years in prison. It is reported that the reason why the girl was sexually assaulted by the monster neighbor for a long time was that the monster neighbor was an acquaintance and had intimidated the girl for a long time.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl with intellectual disabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October this year, Xiaowen, a minor girl from Maoming, Guangdong Province, who has intellectual disability problems, became pregnant and was about to undergo abortion surgery. This was her second sexual assault and second pregnancy in eight months. The previous time, in March of this year, when the police were involved in the investigation, but a similar tragedy happened again in a short period of time.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A case of sexual assault of a mother and daughter (13 years old) with intellectual disabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mentally handicapped mother and daughter in Lianghe Town, Linshui County, Guang&amp;rsquo;an City, Sichuan Province, fell prey to many elderly local men and were sexually assaulted many times. This cruel fact was uncovered because the 13-year-old daughter was found to be more than 5 months pregnant, and the local police took blood from adult males in the town for DNA testing, and found that the suspect was actually an 84-year-old man.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 60-year-old man sexually assaulted a mentally handicapped woman from the same village and was sentenced to three years and seven months in prison&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang, a 60-year-old man in Bozhou, Anhui Province, knew that Zhang XX in the same village was mentally and intellectually disabled, but still had sexual relations with him, but he did not know that his actions constituted the crime of rape. Recently, the Qiaocheng District People&amp;rsquo;s Court of Bozhou City pronounced a verdict on the case, and the court sentenced the defendant Wang Moumou to three years and seven months in prison for rape in the first instance.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was further discovered that some media outlets had investigated these articles, and in addition to telling outrageous storylines, these articles were even more shocking in terms of the figures quoted in the articles. For example, DT Finance once wrote that among the 134 cases of sexual assault of minors it investigated, 54.2% of children under the age of 14 and 8.2% had intellectual disabilities. Among the perpetrators, there are not only strangers who committed random crimes, Didi drivers, netizens who have just met, but also acquaintances including friends, relatives, neighbors, etc. Among them, the proportion of family members committing crimes reached 15.5%, which is the highest proportion of acquaintances committing crimes. In addition, the proportion of repeated sexual assault in cases committed by family members is as high as 94%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 22 months from January 2018 to October 2019, prosecutors across the country prosecuted 32,500 people for sexual assault against minors, an average of 49 per day.&lt;br&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-lack-of-legislation&#34;&gt;2. Lack of legislation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2020 revision of the Law on the Protection of Minors is the main legal basis for the prevention of sexual assault, and the issue of sexual assault is mentioned 11 times, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minors&amp;rsquo; parents and other guardians must not retain persons who have sexually violated minors to care for minors on their behalf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools and kindergartens shall establish systems for the prevention of sexual assault&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools and kindergartens must not conceal situations of sexual violations against minors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools and kindergartens shall carry out education on the prevention of sexual assault&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools and kindergartens shall employ protective measures for minors who have suffered sexual violations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual assault of minors is prohibited&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Units with close contact with minors should review whether the applicant has a record of sexual assault when recruiting staff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State is to establish a system for inquiring into information on persons convicted of sexual assault&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State organs are to carry out necessary protective measures for minor victims of sexual assault and their families&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judicial organs handling cases of sexual violations of minors are to follow the provisions of special procedures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be seen that in terms of the prevention of sexual abuse of minors, the Law on the Protection of Minors mainly limits the rules to schools. But there are still quite a few loopholes in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerabilities at the household&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the family level, the Law on the Protection of Minors only stipulates that when a minor&amp;rsquo;s parents or other guardians are unable to fully perform their guardianship duties due to reasons such as going out to work, they may not entrust a person with a record of sexual assault to take care of a minor on their behalf. There is no regulation for situations such as parents or guardians sexually assaulting minors, and only the relevant catch-all clauses can be applied by reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerabilities at the societal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for how to prevent minors from being sexually assaulted at the social level, in addition to restricting persons with sexual assault records from engaging in occupations that have close contact with minors, no other work measures have been formulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loopholes in the judicial process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the judicial process, there are also great difficulties in the protection of minors with intellectual disabilities. Because the victim is both a minor and a mentally handicapped child, does not have full capacity for conduct, has limited ability to judge violations, cannot understand the social consequences of such conduct, does not know how to protect the scene and evidence, and cannot effectively testify, it is difficult to collect evidence and solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A girl under the age of 18 in Xikou Town, Xiuning County, Anhui Province, was sexually assaulted by three people in the same village from May last year to January this year, resulting in pregnancy. This online post has attracted the attention of many netizens. The bureau responded that on April 26 this year, the public security department immediately intervened in the investigation after receiving the report, and then took criminal coercive measures against the criminal suspect Wang in accordance with the law, and after the case was transferred to the Xiuning County Procuratorate for trial, the procuratorate made a decision not to approve the arrest in accordance with the law, and the criminal suspect has now been changed to residential surveillance. —— &lt;em&gt;It was revealed that a girl in Anhui was sexually assaulted and pregnant by 3 people, and the procuratorate made a decision not to approve the arrest&lt;/em&gt; &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-the-base-number-of-minors-with-intellectual-disabilities-who-have-been-sexually-assaulted&#34;&gt;3. The base number of minors with intellectual disabilities who have been sexually assaulted
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-number-of-people-who-are-difficult-to-count&#34;&gt;The number of people who are difficult to count
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimates from media: 2.8 million&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the population with intellectual disabilities in China has always been a mystery. According to estimates, some self-media say that the proportion of the country&amp;rsquo;s mentally handicapped population is 1%, that is, 14 million, of which 50% are minors, and the number of newborns with intellectual disabilities is about 1.1 million every year. The number of &amp;ldquo;marginal intellectual disabilities&amp;rdquo; who fall between the mentally retarded and the normal (generally with an IQ below 70 as the criterion) is even larger, numbering in the tens of millions.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;em&gt;According to the estimate of 17.95% of the population aged 0-14 in the communiqué of China&amp;rsquo;s Seventh Population Census, minors account for about 20% of the population, the same below.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample survey: 2 million&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the results of China&amp;rsquo;s first national sample survey of disabled persons in 1987, the current disability rate of intellectual disability is 12.7 per thousand (including intellectual disability in comprehensive disability). According to the Second National Sample Survey of Persons with Disabilities in 2006, there were about 9.88 million people with intellectual disabilities (including intellectual disabilities in comprehensive disabilities), accounting for about 0.75 per cent of the total population and 11.9 per cent of the disabled population.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of registrants: 430,000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, the China Disabled Persons&amp;rsquo; Federation (CDPF) launched the construction of a national basic database of persons with disabilities, collecting and managing the basic population information of persons with disabilities in conjunction with the issuance of second-generation certificates for persons with disabilities, and through identity authentication with the Ministry of Public Security&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;National Citizenship Information Service System&amp;rdquo;, it has established the only authoritative national basic information database for persons with disabilities in China. As of June 3, 2013, a total of 37,952,000 persons with disabilities had been collected in the National Basic Database of Persons with Disabilities, of which 2,157,000 were intellectually disabled.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of people served: 170,000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, according to the statistics of the China Disabled Persons&amp;rsquo; Federation, there are 656,000 intellectually disabled people in China in 2022&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;Receiving rehabilitation services decreased by 208,000 from 864,000 in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, it shows that it is indeed difficult to find out the base number of people with intellectual disabilities in China, and on the other hand, it also confirms that the state and society do not pay enough attention to this group. After all, in the folk, the abbreviation of intellectual disability is &amp;ldquo;intellectual disability&amp;rdquo;, which is a common insulting word. As a family, it is obviously impossible to take the initiative to report that their child is &amp;ldquo;mentally retarded&amp;rdquo;, and often can only be counted through hospital identification or other means. But just like the sensational &amp;ldquo;Xuzhou Iron Chain Girl&amp;rdquo;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;The practice of some families imprisoning people with intellectual disabilities for a long time objectively makes it difficult to keep these data in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In horizontal comparison, the prevalence of intellectual disability among children over the age of 5 is about 1% globally, of which about 0.6% is severe intellectual disability&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;。 The National Survey of Children&amp;rsquo;s Health found that in 2011~2012, the intellectual disability rate of children aged 2~17 was about 1.1%&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;。 Domestic academic research usually uses the 0.75% conclusion of the 2006 sample survey as the benchmark for studying this issue.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;That is, the number of minors with intellectual disabilities in China is about 2 million in proportion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, since the average life expectancy of people with intellectual disabilities is obviously much shorter than that of the general population, the actual proportion of minors in the total of about 10 million people with intellectual disabilities should be much higher, and it is more reasonable to have between 3 million and 4 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-number-of-victims-is-more-difficult-to-count&#34;&gt;The number of victims is more difficult to count
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 90s of the last century, some foreign studies found that the group with intellectual disabilities had the highest proportion of sexual abuse among all vulnerable groups&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, 90 per cent of people with intellectual disabilities have experienced sexual assault, and 82 per cent of them have been sexually assaulted before the age of 18&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, about 49% of whom have been sexually assaulted more than 10 times&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;。 For a long time, China&amp;rsquo;s public security departments have not published data on the incidence rate of criminal cases and the rate of solving cases, so it is difficult to find out the data in this area in China.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang Songbo et al., a scholar from mainland China, conducted a survey of hospitalized patients with mental disorders during the recovery period and found that 29.9% of female patients reported having been sexually assaulted, and 75.9% of them reported experiencing physical violence at the same time as they reported having been sexually assaulted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2004 to November 2007, the Lu County People&amp;rsquo;s Court in Sichuan Province accepted and concluded a total of 45 rape cases, of which 21 (46.7 percent) were victims with intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2005 to October 2007, the Beijing Miyun People&amp;rsquo;s Court concluded a total of 86 rape cases, of which 23 (26.7 percent) were victims of intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 2005 to May 2007, the Rugao Municipal People&amp;rsquo;s Court in Jiangsu Province concluded a total of 35 rape cases, of which 14 were victims of intellectual disabilities, accounting for 40 percent. Of these, 4 rape cases were concluded between January and April 2007, and 5 victims were all intellectually disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the influence of traditional culture, women in China have always attached more importance to chastity and honor, and the reporting rate of sexual assault cases is low, and the judicial &amp;ldquo;black number&amp;rdquo; of sexual assault is the highest among all types of crimes. Therefore, in reality, there are a large number of cases of sexual assault of people with intellectual disabilities who are not reported and are dealt with by the judicial authorities. If the standard of 25% in foreign countries is extrapolated, then there should &lt;strong&gt;be no less than 600,000 victims of sexual assault by mentally disabled people in China.&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;em&gt;Review of Research on Sexual Assault of People with Intellectual Disabilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the study found that men with intellectual disabilities are almost equally likely to be sexually assaulted than women, and that men with intellectual disabilities are also at high risk of sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-difficulties-in-preventing-sexual-abuse-of-minors-with-intellectual-disabilities&#34;&gt;4. Difficulties in preventing sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;difficult-to-research&#34;&gt;Difficult to research
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, there is a lack of research on the prevention of sexual assault of minors with intellectual disabilities in China. For example, in terms of sexual assault prevention education, there are few studies on sexual assault prevention education, there are more quantitative studies and less qualitative studies, and most of the research content is research on the current situation and countermeasures of child sexual abuse prevention, but there is little attention paid to how the work is carried out, and how the teaching methods, strategies and effectiveness are.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:21&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:21&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;The reasons for this mainly include the following aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficult to study&lt;/strong&gt;: The study of minors with intellectual disabilities is inherently challenging, because sexual assault incidents may have a low reporting rate due to various reasons (e.g., victims are unable to communicate effectively, fear of retaliation, etc.), and the relevant population may have great difficulties in communication, understanding and expression skills, which greatly increases the difficulty of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low social attention&lt;/strong&gt;: At present, the whole society still pays little attention to people with intellectual disabilities, resulting in insufficient support and attention for related research. In terms of the scope of personal work, the attention to people with intellectual disabilities is far lower than the attention to special groups such as patients with severe mental disorders and the deaf-mute, after all, the latter cause accidents and accidents are very common and more harmful to society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of professionals&lt;/strong&gt;: The study of minors with intellectual disabilities requires expertise in special education, mental health, law, and social work, which may be relatively lacking. In the process of research, I found that there is a big gap between the countermeasures, suggestions or specific measures proposed by many papers in this field and the actual situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;strong-concealment&#34;&gt;Strong concealment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, due to social and cultural prejudices, people have generally been in a state of &amp;ldquo;talking about sexual perversion&amp;rdquo;, and they have avoided the issue of sexual assault. As for the sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities, it is itself superimposed with multiple prejudices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marginalized groups&lt;/strong&gt; People with intellectual disabilities are marginalized groups, often not regarded as normal people, and are easily excluded and discriminated against by society. It is difficult for family members to maintain rational choices when dealing with people with intellectual disabilities, and many families are prone to choose inhumane ways to treat people with intellectual disabilities due to economic factors and various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;way forward&lt;/strong&gt; Few families of origin can take care of people with intellectual disabilities for the rest of their lives, and most families will choose to seek another home for people with intellectual disabilities when they become adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For women with intellectual disabilities, traditional Chinese rural families often take advantage of their normal fertility to marry off to groups such as &amp;ldquo;old singles&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;disabled people&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;absolute poor households&amp;rdquo; , so that the original family can get rid of the &amp;ldquo;burden&amp;rdquo;. Families with better family conditions are likely to spend extra money and find them a slightly better partner, as was the case with a cousin of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For men with intellectual disabilities, it is even more miserable, often sent out by their families to do the hardest, most tiring or simple physical work, and suffer the most exploitation. I have two twin cousins who are currently in this state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this context, in order to achieve the purpose of &amp;ldquo;marriage&amp;rdquo;, the original family of the person with intellectual disabilities may still conceal the fact that the minor is sexually assaulted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relatives commit crimes&lt;/strong&gt; Due to the lack of awareness of people with intellectual disabilities and their high dependence on relatives, relatives have more opportunities to have intimate contact with them alone, which objectively increases the possibility of sexual abuse by relatives. And this kind of sexual assault is extremely difficult for the public power and the outside world to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-the-general-idea-of-preventing-sexual-abuse-of-minors&#34;&gt;5. The general idea of preventing sexual abuse of minors
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the provisions of the Law on the Protection of Minors on the prevention of sexual abuse of minors are not satisfactory, many measures and future plans are proposed in other laws and administrative regulations, but no special attention is paid to the issue of sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;legal-aspects&#34;&gt;Legal aspects
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Law on the Promotion of Family Education stipulates that the parents or other guardians of minors shall pay attention to the mental health of minors in light of the physical and mental development characteristics of minors of different ages, educate them on safety knowledge in areas such as sexual assault prevention, help them master safety knowledge and skills, and enhance their awareness and ability to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Civil Code provides protective provisions on the statute of limitations for the right to claim compensation for sexual assault of minors, which shall be calculated from the date on which the victim reaches the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;at-the-level-of-administrative-regulations&#34;&gt;At the level of administrative regulations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main norms of administrative regulations on the prevention of sexual abuse of minors are the Notice on the Development of Chinese Women and the Program for the Development of Chinese Children (2021-2030) issued by the State Council, which lists nearly 20 preventive measures, in addition to the same measures listed in the Law on the Protection of Minors, there are the following plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively control and severely punish illegal and criminal acts of rape, indecency, and humiliation of girls and women with intellectual or mental disabilities, and prevent and severely punish illegal and criminal acts of sexual violations against children in accordance with law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual assault committed by persons with special responsibilities to children is severely punished in accordance with law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish and improve mechanisms for caring for key populations and families, mechanisms for discovering and reporting infringement cases, mechanisms for joint prevention and coordination of multiple departments, and systems for supervising the promotion of infringement cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raise awareness and capacity among children, families, schools, and communities to identify, prevent, prevent, and report sexual abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explore the establishment of a system for disclosing information on persons who have committed crimes against children, and strictly implement a system for the filing of foreign teachers&amp;rsquo; certificates of no criminal record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengthen case filing and case filing supervision, and improve case filing standards and conviction and sentencing standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explore the formulation of special evidentiary standards for cases of sexual violations against children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly punish illegal and criminal conduct that uses the internet to sexually lure or sexually violate children in accordance with law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;departmental-rules-and-local-regulations&#34;&gt;Departmental rules and local regulations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the level of departmental regulations, it is mainly the education, the Communist Youth League, the women&amp;rsquo;s federation and other institutions that make special provisions on the prevention of sexual assault on students. For example, in December 2018, the General Office of the Ministry of Education issued a notice on further strengthening the prevention of sexual assault of students in primary and secondary schools (kindergartens) , proposing five work measures. However, the content of the measures is generally the same as those enumerated in the Law on the Protection of Minors, with the main difference being that the preventive responsibilities of local government bodies and schools are emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of local regulations and local government normative documents, it is mainly a refinement of the Law on the Protection of Minors and other laws and regulations at the national level, most of which are copied from the original text, and no new measures are proposed. For example, the regulations on the protection of minors in Beijing, Shandong and other places, the three-year action implementation plan for improving the quality of care services for left-behind children and children in difficult situations in urban and rural areas in Chongqing, and the construction plan for child-friendly cities in Huzhou (2023-2025).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-special-system-for-the-prevention-of-sexual-abuse-of-minors-with-intellectual-disabilities&#34;&gt;6. Special system for the prevention of sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, for minors with intellectual disabilities who are enrolled in school normally, the state has established a preliminary prevention system in the construction of a sexual assault prevention system. However, for minors with intellectual disabilities who have completed compulsory education (generally 15 years old), some minors with intellectual disabilities who are unable to attend school normally, and there is still a certain gap in how to prevent the sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities at the family and social levels, I personally believe that a special system for preventing the sexual abuse of minors with intellectual disabilities can be established from the following aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproductive intervention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Actively intervenes in family fertility services for people with intellectual disabilities to help them understand the reproductive process and possible consequences, so that families with intellectual disabilities can have equal opportunities and resources so that they can make reproductive decisions that are suitable for them. When necessary, in special circumstances such as where minors with intellectual disabilities are sexually assaulted and pregnant, medical services for the termination of pregnancy shall be actively intervened, to ensure that the reproductive rights of minors with intellectual disabilities are respected, and to avoid unnecessary new social tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Carry out regular assessments for minors with intellectual disabilities, and establish a team of multidisciplinary professionals including doctors, nurses, psychological counselors, social workers, and other multidisciplinary professionals through cooperation with medical institutions, social welfare institutions, educational institutions, and other relevant institutions, to provide comprehensive status assessment services for minors with intellectual disabilities, assess possible problems in home and school supervision, and check whether there are sexual assaults and other violent victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family Follow-up Surveys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Establish a system of face-to-face home visits, with teachers, social workers, and other personnel regularly carrying out home visit services to the families of minors with intellectual disabilities, assessing the growth status of minors with intellectual disabilities in the family, and investigating possible sexual assault and other violent victimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promote smart wearable devices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ma Dugong, a self-media person, has been strongly advocating that all minors should wear smart wearable devices to avoid possible accidents. Although this idea is obviously too extreme, if it is only carried out among minors with intellectual disabilities, it may be a very good practice, and the government can provide the equipment free of charge, and continue to monitor the use of the equipment, supporting the special protection of face-to-face interviews, evaluations and other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement special legal rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Give full play to the preventive effects of criminal punishments, establish special detection rules for cases of sexual assault on minors with intellectual disabilities, and avoid emboldening potential criminals due to some unsolvable cases. For example, where minors with intellectual disabilities are unable to verbally express the circumstances of the violation, they may learn from the practices of foreign countries and the Taiwan region and use dolls with anatomical details of the human body to use body language instead, which is to be treated as the victim&amp;rsquo;s statement.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Taiwan began to purchase a large number of domestic violence and sexual assault prevention and treatment centers in the jurisdiction. In order to assist in the investigation of sexual assault crimes against young children and children with intellectual disabilities, and to increase the rate of prosecution and conviction, the relevant departments of Taiwan have developed and produced male and female interrogation dolls of different genders as tools to assist case handlers in questioning specific child victims. Pop-up books, human body charts, and other related tools commonly used in daily life assist in questioning juvenile victims. &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Research on the issue of the acceptance of victims&amp;rsquo; statements in cases of sexual assault against minors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:22&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:22&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reflections on Murder Prevention</title>

        <pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/reflections-on-murder-prevention/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/reflections-on-murder-prevention/images/pexels-photo-270220.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Reflections on Murder Prevention" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appalling murder case that recently occurred in Handan City, Hebei Province, reminded me of an incident in our small city last year. Although this event was not widely known, it had a significant impact on the local area and became a landmark event. The story is simple: in a traditional manufacturing company, a male employee killed a female employee due to a relationship dispute and then committed suicide, resulting in the tragic death of both. This incident became the last straw that shattered our city’s image of safety, casting a thick shadow over a city that was once praised as the safest area in the Pearl River Delta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-and-background&#34;&gt;Case and Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why this incident became a significant event does not lie in the terrifying nature of the crime or the special backgrounds of the murderer and the victim. The manufacturing company involved is just an ordinary small local company, and both employees come from ordinary families without any “identity labels” that could be hyped by the media. The crime was committed using a wet towel to suffocate the victim, and the suicide was caused by carbon monoxide poisoning from indoor charcoal burning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;murder-rate&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Murder Rate&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key factor is that, with a population of only 500,000 in our small city, according to international standards for evaluating murder rates, every homicide increases the murder rate per 100,000 people by 0.2%. The target set by our superiors is to keep this data below 0.5%, meaning that our small city can only have a maximum of two murder cases per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;goal-of-being-the-safest&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal of Being the Safest&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2018, Guangdong Province, with a population of 130 million, set an important development goal to become the safest, fairest, and most just region with the best legal environment in all of China. In this pursuit of excellence, the murder rate is one of the most important indicators receiving greater attention. In fact, all provinces in China, except Taiwan, regard safety indicators as a top priority for the government. According to the common understanding of most Chinese people, the higher the level of economic development, the better the security, and the more economically and socially underdeveloped areas are prone to heinous crimes. After all, as the saying goes, “Poor mountains and evil waters breed cunning people.” As China’s top economic province, Guangdong’s goal also aligns with the expectations of most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;political-responsibility&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the murder rate indicator, since it is a very objective indicator that is almost impossible to manipulate, its achievement is extremely difficult and requires a significant cost and sacrifice. To achieve the goals set by the national and provincial governments, various rules have been established to ensure the full implementation of the responsibility for preventing murders. If any province, city, county, or even township exceeds the standard, it will face strong political pressure from its superior government departments. Furthermore, if the number of cases exceeds a certain limit, the area will be blacklisted and required to carry out key rectifications. The main responsible persons of the government will face severe political responsibilities, and the local city will not be allowed to participate in various excellence evaluations and awards. The bonus income of all public employees in the local government will also be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, in the case mentioned above, although two people died, only the victim was counted in the murder death toll, while the suicide was recorded in another indicator of suicide rate per 100,000 people. However, compared to murder cases, suicides are slightly less important and have less social harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;global-comparison&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Comparison&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the latest statistics from the World Bank on global murder rates, as of 2020, China’s ranking is relatively high, about 10th in the world. Countries with lower murder rates than China include Bahrain, Singapore, Kuwait, Japan, Oman, Vanuatu, Qatar, Luxembourg, and Italy, with a combined population of only 2.5% of the world’s total. Even Switzerland and Norway, which are considered “paradise”-like livable developed countries, rank behind China. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://data.worldbank.org.cn/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5?end=2020&amp;amp;locations=CN-US-IN-BR-RU-ZA&amp;amp;most_recent_value_desc=false&amp;amp;start=2019&amp;amp;type=points&amp;amp;view=chart&amp;amp;year=2021&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;traditional-chinese-theories-of-murder-prevention&#34;&gt;Traditional Chinese Theories of Murder Prevention
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, the theory of crime prevention has been an important part of Chinese philosophy. Ancient Chinese sages regarded “treating the disease before it occurs, managing chaos before it arises” as the highest realm and the best strategy for governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;feudal-dynasty-era&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feudal Dynasty Era&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During 500 BC, Laozi proposed, “Act before things exist, manage before disorder arises.” Guanzi stated, “In governing a country, it is necessary to enrich the people first. …When the people are wealthy, they will value their homes and villages, respect their superiors, and fear punishment, making them easy to govern. When the people are poor, they will disregard their homes and villages, daring to defy authority and break laws, making them difficult to govern.” Dong Zhongshu of the Han Dynasty suggested, “The people’s pursuit of benefits is like water flowing downhill; without the dam of moral education to contain it, it cannot be stopped. Therefore, when moral education is established and all evildoing is halted, it is because the dam is complete; when moral education is abandoned and evildoing prevails, and punishment cannot prevail, it is because the dam is broken.” Over a period of more than 2000 years under the ruling philosophy of “external leniency and internal law,” strict punishment was often used as a fallback means of governing the country, while Confucianism’s “benevolence, love, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness” served as educational means to prevent crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;modern-prevention-theories&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Prevention Theories&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the emergence of modern Western legal theories, the preventive effect of law has been discussed as a legal and ethical principle associated with the development of productivity and the risk society. Particularly since the rise of the technological revolution, in the late 1960s, Sweden and Germany took the lead in proposing the principle of prevention in the fields of environmental law and policy. By the 1980s and 1990s, the principle of prevention began to be widely accepted in international and domestic environmental law. Since the 21st century, the principle of prevention has been recognized by various legal fields beyond environmental law and has become a powerful and dominant legal principle. It is used as a legitimate reason for various government regulations and legal interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fengqiao-experience&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fengqiao Experience&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1963, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed that the “Fengqiao Experience” from Zhuji City, Zhejiang Province, should be studied and promoted nationwide. The main content of the “Fengqiao Experience” is to “mobilize and rely on the masses, persist in not escalating contradictions, solve problems locally, achieve fewer arrests, and maintain good public order,” along with a series of institutional measures to ensure the desired outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Experiences&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Intorduce&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Fengqiao Experiences”1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;handle minor issues within the village and major issues within the town, resolving contradictions locally without escalating them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Fengqiao Experiences”2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;assist individuals who have completed their sentences.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“Fengqiao Experiences”3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;management of migrant workers in a new model.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-contemporary-fengqiao-experience&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The contemporary “Fengqiao Experience”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contemporary “Fengqiao Experience” is rooted in China’s excellent traditional culture, embodying the spirit and wisdom of the Chinese nation. It aligns with the governance concept of “morality as the main, law as the auxiliary, understanding virtue and exercising punishment with caution,” the principle of “preparing for the future and preventing ahead of time,” the judicial concept of “valuing harmony and stopping litigation,” and the cultural gene of “valuing righteousness over profit, with righteousness before profit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contemporary “Fengqiao Experience” can be summarized as prevention first, mediation priority, application of law, and local resolution. In terms of the nature of contradictions, it deals with internal contradictions among the people. Regarding the objects of contradictions, it is mainly used to better address the reasonable and legitimate demands of the masses. In terms of working methods, the contemporary “Fengqiao Experience” uses negotiation and mediation as the primary approach, giving full play to the role of law in resolving disputes, and focuses on balancing social interests, regulating social relations, and standardizing social behaviors within the orbit of the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;theory-of-contradictions-among-the-people&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theory of Contradictions Among the People&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 60 years, China’s economy and society have undergone tremendous changes, and the content and manifestation of social contradictions have also changed, with new types of crimes emerging. However, overall, China still adopts strategies based on the theory of “internal contradictions among the people” to promote problem-solving. In the “contradiction theory,” the contradictions between enemies and ourselves are antagonistic, while the contradictions within the people are non-antagonistic. Among the ruled and ruling classes, in addition to the antagonistic aspect, there is also a non-antagonistic aspect. According to this theory, if non-antagonistic contradictions are not resolved in a timely manner, they are likely to become antagonistic. Conversely, antagonistic contradictions may also ease and show a non-antagonistic side. Therefore, in socialist China, if you ask an ordinary person who the ruled class is, most people would first think of criminals serving sentences. The relationship between criminals and the people is already in an enemy-ourselves contradiction. For criminals who have completed their sentences, it is ultimately necessary for them to return to society and the masses, at which point the antagonistic contradictions have already begun to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, compared to the 1960s, the specific content and manifestation of the internal contradictions among the people in contemporary China have also undergone significant changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population Changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a fundamental change in the proportion of urban and rural populations. In the 1960s, China’s urbanization rate was only 15%, but it has now increased to 66%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The population composition has become complex. In the 1960s, China’s social population was divided into a few types such as workers, peasants, and intellectuals, but it has now been subdivided into 8 major categories and more than 1800 types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a fundamental change in population mobility. In the 1960s, the vast majority of China’s population lived, worked, and lived in the same area, but currently, the number of people separated from their household registration has reached more than 500 million, exceeding the national population size of the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in the Content of Contradictions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, the main contradiction in Chinese society was judged to be the class contradiction, that is, the contradiction between the exploiting class and the exploited class. Overthrowing the exploiting class was considered as important as overthrowing the “three mountains” of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main contradiction in contemporary Chinese society is widely recognized as the contradiction between the people’s growing needs for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development. People’s demands for democracy, rule of law, fairness, justice, security, and the environment have significantly increased, with more attention to new contradictions such as real estate, finance, and public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External Environment Changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world pattern, the trade war and so-called “new cold war” unilaterally initiated by the United States against China have had a direct and significant impact on some industries that are developing in China, affecting employment, income,and investment security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the economic structure, after decades of development, China has now become the world’s second-largest economy, although there is still a significant gap from its historical position as the world’s largest economy for a long time, there has been a fundamental change compared to the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the information structure, the development of the internet has significantly changed the way people communicate or interact, with the vast majority of individuals unlikely to express extreme opinions in real life, but such information is readily available online, exacerbating the formation of contradictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the governance structure, in the 1960s, China still highly revered the “rule by man” model and regarded it as the sole or primary approach. But now, the concept of the rule of law has taken root in people’s hearts. According to the World Bank’s 2020 Doing Business report, China’s ranking in the overall list has risen to 31st globally, with the rule of law in the business environment ranking relatively higher, and “quality of judicial procedures” topping the global list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;murder-cases-must-be-solved&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Murder cases must be solved.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After China implemented the “Reform and Opening-up” policy in 1978, the society was filled with vitality and numerous development opportunities, leading to an unprecedented phenomenon of free inter-regional movement among the people. This process also provided opportunities for criminals to commit crimes across regions, resulting in frequent occurrences of such cases and causing serious harm to the safety of people’s lives and property. Consequently, a term was coined within the Chinese police circles: “Murder cases must be solved.” Whether in the civil law system or the common law system, criminal law theories agree that an important function of criminal law is to prevent crime through the punishment of offenders. However, they also emphasize the extreme importance of “procedural justice,” considering it more significant than “substantive justice” and firmly advocating for the abolition of the death penalty. As a result, phenomena such as the acquittal of suspects in cases like the O.J. Simpson murder trial, or the Swedish mass murderer Breivik being sentenced to only 21 years in prison after killing 77 people, occur. However, such issues are absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. According to traditional Chinese theory, “killing someone must be compensated with life; it is a natural principle.” For heinous murder cases, even if there are flaws in the judicial process, as long as the facts stand up to scrutiny, judgments must be made based on the facts. It is under this principle that “murder cases must be solved” has become an inevitable pursuit. Therefore, an important aspect of discussions about murder cases on the contemporary Chinese internet is the unsolved cases from the 1980-1990s that remained due to the lack of necessary technical detection methods at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the principle of “murder cases must be solved,” there have been instances of wrongful convictions, but compared to the vast number of cases over the decades, and the countless innocent victims who have lost their lives, these instances are extremely rare. Moreover, most of these wrongful convictions were not executed due to difficulties in making a decisive judgment at the time, and all have since been acquitted. Of course, with the current level of technology in China, it is almost impossible for cases to be declared solved based solely on torture and the confession of suspects, as was the case in the 1980s. The “wrongful convictions” that have come to light in recent years almost all occurred before 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-practices-in-murder-prevention&#34;&gt;Current Practices in Murder Prevention
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the guidance of Xi Jinping’s legal system thought and the overall national security concept, contemporary Chinese political and legal practices have constructed a preventive governance system comprised of multiple sub-systems. The first sub-system aims to prevent crime and maintain social order. As early as 2001, the Central Committee of the CPC and the State Council put forth the policy of “combining crackdowns with prevention, with prevention as the priority” in their “Opinions on Further Strengthening the Comprehensive Management of Social Security.” In recent years, public security agencies have established the concept of “proactive policing” and “preventive policing,” emphasizing proactive investigation, monitoring, and early warning to detect potential criminal activities before they occur. The goal is to prevent incidents before they escalate, thereby minimizing harm and losses to the public. The second sub-system is aimed at preventing disputes and conflicts through diversified resolution methods. The 17th meeting of the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms in 2015 stressed the improvement of the diversified dispute resolution mechanism: “Persist in source governance and prevention as the main principle, integrate the prevention of disputes throughout the entire process of major decision-making, administrative law enforcement, and judicial litigation.” To address the periods of heightened social disputes, surge in litigation cases, and frequent petition problems, judicial organs have proposed the concepts of origin governance for lawsuits, police action, and petitions, continuously enhancing the capability to prevent and resolve disputes. The third sub-system targets preventing public safety risks in governance. The report of the 20th National Congress of the CPC proposed: “Adhere to safety as the priority and prevention as the main approach, establish a comprehensive safety and emergency response framework, improve the public safety system and promote the transformation of the public safety governance model towards prevention before incidents occur.” In recent years, the public safety governance model has been accelerating its shift from post-incident response to pre-incident prevention, moving from traditional areas like production safety, transportation safety, food and drug safety, and hazardous materials safety to new fields including public health safety, bio-safety, and cyber security.&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;#720cb51f-e04a-4ea1-b2fa-f98f3eba2fb1&#34; &gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, given the relatively low incidence rate of homicides in China, the occurrence of such incidents is highly random and difficult to precisely predict. The entire society is constantly experiencing various disputes and conflicts, but it is challenging to discern which of these will escalate into homicides due to the lack of clear signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;randomness&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Randomness&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking the most typical “crime of passion” as an example, a verbal altercation on the street can rapidly evolve into a violent incident. For this type of spontaneous homicide prevention, institutional designs must be developed from a broader perspective. For example, as early as 2002, China proposed to build a harmonious society. For individuals, “harmony” hopes that everyone can handle affairs with a more peaceful and stable mindset, avoiding extremes. Additionally, systematic poverty alleviation projects carried out by China over the past decades serve as another form of crime prevention for those in absolute poverty who believe that “life will not get worse anyhow.” After all, traditional Chinese culture has always believed that “the granary is full, and one knows the etiquette” and “those with constant property have a constant heart”; with certain economic conditions, people are less likely to resolve disputes using primitive, violent means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;difficulty-in-prevention&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty in Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a recent homicide case in Handan City, Hebei Province, where three middle school students under the age of 14 killed a classmate and buried the body, has drawn great attention from the Chinese public and dominated headlines for a month. &lt;code&gt;According to Chinese criminal law, the general age of criminal responsibility is 16, and for eight types of serious violent crimes, including intentional homicide, it is 14 years old. For minors between the ages of 12 and 14, prosecution can only proceed with approval from the Supreme People&#39;s Procuratorate; such cases are exceedingly rare.&lt;/code&gt; Preventing juvenile crimes is even more challenging, as the malicious actions of the suspects are beyond everyone’s expectations, and hardly anyone would believe that 12-year-olds could commit such acts. It can be anticipated that, following this incident, government departments across China will intensify efforts to prevent juvenile delinquency, strengthening all-around protection for minors affected by school violence.Current Practices in Homicide Prevention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prevention-over-choice&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention Over Choice&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a Chinese saying that goes, “Better a thousand times careful than once overconfident,” meaning that even for events with a low probability, one should invest a thousandfold effort into prevention. This was fully demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control process from 2020 to 2022. In order to prevent the spread of the virus and avoid loss of life, China was not hesitant to implement the rare measure of “city lockdown,” a strategy unprecedented in recent human history. Even though some local governments adopted excessive epidemic prevention measures to ensure “zero risk” during the subsequent stages of the pandemic, these actions still garnered widespread public support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;main-approaches&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Approaches&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murder prevention is a systematic project without a standard answer or shortcuts. As a popular joke goes, “When faced with multiple answers, children make choices, while adults take them all.” In my work, I have encountered more than ten approaches, which include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focused prevention during key periods: Analyze the times of the year when homicides are more likely to occur and implement targeted deployments. For example, there is a tradition in China to collect debts before the Lunar New Year, a period prone to severe incidents due to debt collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-time analysis and judgment of public security situations: Police use big data models to analyze “police situations, case situations, public sentiment, and social conditions” in their jurisdictions and organize corresponding response measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflict mediation and resolution: Implement graded alerts for disputes that could escalate into criminal cases, such as those involving marriages, economic transactions, neighborly relations, and illegal construction demolition, and assign personnel to follow up on each case to reduce conflicts at the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted problem rectification: Concentrate on resolving prominent public security issues in the area that could lead to homicides. For example, from 2018 to 2020, China carried out a three-year special campaign against organized crime, busting 3,644 gangs and 11,675 criminal groups, and arresting 237,000 suspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevention of civil cases turning criminal: Strengthen the coordination of people’s mediation, litigation, and petitioning work to ensure that disputes among the public can be resolved through public channels, preventing private violent rights protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Safe Family” initiative: Use traditional moral teachings to promote harmony within families and prevent domestic disputes from escalating into homicides. Family disputes are one of the leading causes of homicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management of floating population services: mainly focus on strengthening the investigation of individuals with criminal records and potential mobile offenders, dynamically mastering population information to prevent crimes committed by outsiders. In the 1980s, China experienced several serious cases of mobile homicides, which were extremely heinous and still send chills down the spine today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management of unemployed and non-student youth: Provide one-on-one support and management for unemployed and non-student youth to promote their employment and education, preventing them from going astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supervision and management of individuals with mental disorders: Implement a guardianship system for individuals with severe mental disorders according to a classified management system to ensure that “all those who should be treated are treated.” In the past decade, as the number of homicides in China has continued to decline, the issue of mentally ill individuals causing accidents, traditionally neglected, has begun to emerge. Through several years of effort, this issue has been well controlled overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service and management of special groups: mainly strengthen the daily management of individuals involved in organized crime, those released from prison, community corrections individuals, and drug users. For key individuals such as those prone to violent behavior after drinking or threatening revenge, strengthen ideological education, psychological counseling, humanistic care, and crisis intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive social security prevention and control: mainly use technical means to strengthen crime risk prevention, increase police patrols, improve the visibility of police officers and flashing police lights in public places, and deter potential criminal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management of key industries and places: mainly strengthen the management of places like restaurants, night markets, dance halls, chess and card rooms, and small and medium-sized hotels that are prone to group fights and picking quarrels, and strictly control firearms, flammable and explosive materials, and highly toxic substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive management of campus security: includes strengthening patrols around campuses, improving campus security facilities, strengthening the investigation of teacher-student disputes and dangerous articles such as controlled knives, and establishing systems to prevent campus violence and bullying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical case warning education: use various law popularization methods to carry out legal education, increase legal assistance, and guide the public to develop the habit of resolving disputes and safeguarding rights through legal channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social sentiment monitoring and psychological counseling services: provide psychological counseling and crisis intervention in a timely manner for special groups with prominent conflicts, dissatisfaction with life, imbalance of mindset, and abnormal behavior, and improve their ability to withstand frustration and adapt to the environment, preventing individual extreme violent crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These measures, overall, do not have a so-called order of importance; every aspect is crucial, and the neglect of any one thing could lead to indulgence or even result in loss of life. However, for a mature society, there is a need to consider the cost of any action taken, even according to traditional Chinese thinking that “human life is paramount” and that protecting life is above all else. That does not mean, however, that there can be an endless pit of investment; in fact, it is impossible to achieve absolute safety. Sometimes, I feel that given the current level of economic and social development in China, the achievements in safety that have been made are already a miracle in the history of human development. Many countries at the same stage of economic and social development as China currently face numerous internal problems, and the incidence of homicides and various crimes is far higher than in China. Even in developed countries like the United States, the homicide rate is more than ten times higher than in China. It must be said that this so-called “beacon of human civilization” has its own dark humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Maslow’s classic hierarchy of needs theory, there are five levels of human needs, including survival, safety, social interaction, respect, and self-actualization. However, in thousands of years of Chinese philosophy, human needs are only divided into two categories: survival and development. In comparison, I believe that Maslow’s hierarchy of needs principle is too idealistic, as it has a clear flaw in real-world logic. That is, the relationship from the bottom to the top of the pyramid is not strictly progressive; even if one or two layers are removed from the middle of the pyramid, people can still achieve higher-level needs. For example, Einstein developed the theory of relativity during times of war, and even after achieving fame and success, he still had to worry about his safety. The same is true for the U.S. President and the Prime Minister of Japan; upon becoming the President or Prime Minister, they have already reached the pinnacle of self-realization, yet they still have to worry about assassination attempts. Similarly, during the turbulent times in China, many revolutionary predecessors and benevolent people achieved their highest ideals without any guarantee of survival or safety, and their deeds are forever remembered by future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the contemporary Chinese political discourse, survival and development have been upgraded to safety and development. One important factor is that China has historically resolved the issue of absolute poverty that has plagued the nation for thousands of years, and survival itself is a basic component of ensuring safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logical relationship between safety and development is very clear: safety is the prerequisite and necessary condition for development, while development can promote the formation of a higher level of security pattern. The two complement each other, forming a spiral structure that continuously rises. Moreover, this logical relationship applies perfectly to the nation, society, and individuals alike. Therefore, better addressing the concerns for the life and safety of the people has become an inevitable choice for the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, I would like to quote a passage on safety from the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We will advance the modernization of the national security system and capabilities, resolutely safeguard national security and social stability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must adhere to the principle of ensuring the safety of the people, with political security as the foundation, economic security as the basis, and the security of military, science and technology, culture, and society as the guarantee. We should also rely on promoting international security, coordinate external and internal security, homeland security and public security, traditional and non-traditional security, and our own security and common security. We need to plan for both maintaining and shaping national security, strengthen the grassroots foundation for national security and social stability, improve the mechanisms for participating in global security governance, and build a safer China at a higher level to ensure a new development pattern with a new security structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will improve the national security system. We must uphold the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee over national security work and perfect an efficient and authoritative national security leadership system. We will strengthen the coordination mechanism for national security work, improve the legal, strategic, policy, risk monitoring and early warning systems, and the national emergency management system. We will enhance the security assurance systems in key areas and the important special coordination and command systems. We will also strengthen the construction of security systems in the fields of the economy, major infrastructure, finance, cyberspace, data, biology, resources, nuclear, space, and the oceans. We will establish mechanisms to counter sanctions, interference, and “long-arm jurisdiction.” We will improve the layout of national security forces and build a comprehensive, linked, three-dimensional, and efficient national security protection system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will enhance our ability to maintain national security. We will resolutely safeguard the security of national political power, systems, and ideology. We will strengthen the capacity for security in key areas to ensure the safety of food, energy resources, and critical industrial and supply chains. We will enhance the capacity for overseas security to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and legal persons abroad, and to safeguard maritime rights and interests. We will resolutely defend national sovereignty, security, and development interests. We will improve our ability to prevent and resolve major risks, strictly guard against systemic security risks, and severely crack down on activities by hostile forces to infiltrate, destroy, subvert, and divide. We will comprehensively strengthen national security education, improve the ability of leaders at all levels to coordinate development and security, and enhance the national security awareness and culture of all people to build a strong line of defense for national security among the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will improve the level of public safety governance. We will adhere to the principle of safety first and prevention as the main priority, establish a framework for comprehensive security and emergency response, improve the public safety system, and shift the model of public safety governance towards preventive measures. We will promote special rectification of safety production risks, strengthen safety supervision in key industries and areas, and improve the capacity for disaster prevention, mitigation, relief, and emergency response to major public incidents. We will strengthen the construction of national and regional emergency response capabilities. We will enhance the supervision and control of food and drug safety and establish a sound biosafety supervision, early warning, and prevention system. We will strengthen the protection of personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will improve the social governance system. We will establish a sound system of social governance characterized by joint construction, governance, and sharing, and enhance the effectiveness of social governance. At the grassroots level, we will adhere to and develop the “Fengqiao Experience” for the new era, improve the mechanisms for correctly handling internal contradictions among the people under new circumstances, and strengthen and improve the work of letters and visits from the public. We will facilitate and standardize the channels for expressing demands, coordinating interests, and protecting rights and interests, improve the grassroots governance platform supported by grid management, refined services, and informatization, and establish a sound urban and rural community governance system. We will resolve conflicts and disputes at the grassroots level and in their early stages. We will accelerate the modernization of city-based social governance and improve its capabilities. We will strengthen the overall prevention and control of public order and promote the normalization of efforts to combat and eliminate gangs and violence, and severely punish various crimes strongly felt by the public in accordance with the law. We will strengthen the forces for mass prevention and mass control, foster a social atmosphere where righteousness is rewarded, and build a community of social governance where everyone has a responsibility, everyone fulfills their duties, and everyone shares in the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

        <pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/participating-in-rural-public-welfare-activities/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/participating-in-rural-public-welfare-activities/images/img_20240401_15481418491084328636247.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Participating in rural public welfare activities" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have been participating in a series of rural volunteer public welfare activities for several days. The main tasks are twofold: one is to help solve the problem of rural uncleanliness, and the other is to carry out tree planting activities in rural areas. Here, I would like to focus on the reasons behind the first issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**I. Land Nature Problem&lt;br&gt;
**Due to the nature of land ownership in China, which is only state-owned land and rural collective land, all urban land is state-owned, while most rural land is collectively owned by local villagers. In both urban and rural areas, lakes, mines, rivers, railways, highways, and national roads are also owned by the state. However, during the process of urbanization, the actual demarcation between collective land and state-owned land is not as clear as it seems, especially in the border areas between cities and rural areas. It is almost impossible for ordinary people to accurately identify whether the land they are standing on is state-owned or collective. This has led to a significant social issue, namely, who is responsible for waste disposal. According to land ownership, if it is waste on state-owned land, the government has specific departments responsible for its management. But if it is waste on collective land in rural areas, the responsibility falls on the local villagers. For the government, with tax revenue and financial income, they can well afford the sanitation work within the city. However, for rural collectives, it is impossible to tax the villagers and it is also difficult to ask them to pay for sanitation services, given their generally lower incomes. The rural sanitation work often relies on the staff of the villagers&amp;rsquo; committees, but these personnel are scarce, making it difficult for them to spare time from their regular duties to engage in sanitation work.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**II. Land Dispute Problem&lt;br&gt;
**Due to the rapid development of urbanization in China, cities are inevitably encroaching on rural land, converting collective land ownership into state-owned land. This process is known as &amp;ldquo;land requisition.&amp;rdquo; However, because the process of land requisition itself requires a lengthy administrative procedure, local governments cannot start the process only when the land is about to be used. They usually plan ahead many years in advance and start the requisition plan by purchasing the collective land and storing it. After the government buys the collective land, another crucial step is the approval of the superior government. Typically, the central government will annually set a maximum number for converting collective land into state-owned land, and each province, city, and administrative area must strictly adhere to their respective maximum numbers for changing land ownership within their quotas. If the indicators are exceeded, the relevant officials will be held accountable. In fact, many local officials have been held criminally responsible for this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to a problem: in the eyes of the villagers, the collective land in their own village has been purchased by the government and is no longer considered their own; however, from the government&amp;rsquo;s perspective, although the land has been paid for, in terms of legal ownership, it remains collective land. Once these lands become deserted for more than two years or encounter other legal disputes, there is a high likelihood that they may revert to the villagers. Additionally, the collective land collected by the government, due to its original agricultural use, cannot be utilized with the various machinery and equipment employed in urban sanitation cleaning processes. Moreover, since neither party is willing to take on the responsibility of sanitation cleaning, it is easy for third parties to take advantage of this situation. Some urban residents and small and medium-sized enterprises may take the opportunity to dump garbage on these lands when there is no supervision, or even illegally occupy these lands to construct temporary structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**III. Villagers&amp;rsquo; Initiative Problem&lt;br&gt;
**Collective land is collectively owned by the local villagers. In theory, each villager has the responsibility to maintain the sanitation of the collective land. However, since this responsibility is collective rather than proportional, it is impossible to quantify how much each villager should specifically contribute to the cleaning. If villagers collectively carry out cleaning, it will also lead to the phenomenon of &amp;ldquo;the more capable, the more responsible,&amp;rdquo; causing those who are more actively involved to bear more. Moreover, the current major problem in rural areas is population &amp;ldquo;hollowing out,&amp;rdquo; with most of the working-age population having moved to cities to seek a living, leaving behind mostly the elderly and left-behind children. The village we visited had a registered population of 4,275, but the actual daily resident population was only 2,184, with 52% being over 60 years old. Particularly in some remote areas of the village, many houses built over 40 or 50 years ago have been abandoned by their owners. These uninhabited places have become the &amp;ldquo;paradise&amp;rdquo; for those who dump garbage randomly, and without someone checking, these piles of garbage might remain undiscovered for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**IV. About Tree Planting in Rural Areas&lt;br&gt;
**March 12th is designated as Tree Planting Day in China. Every year at this time, Chinese people engage in various tree planting activities. For example, this year, on Tree Planting Day, the public welfare volunteer service I participated in planted a total of 1,100 trees in a village. Apart from a small part where excavators can be used, most of the planting is still done manually. While tree planting is generally easy, ensuring the survival rate of the saplings is much more challenging. The trees we planted in early March have already started to turn yellow and wither, requiring follow-up replanting. But some of the trees have grown well. For example, the row of yellow goldenrain trees we planted next to the IKEA Home Furnishing Logistics Base has already bloomed after only 20-plus days.&lt;/p&gt;

The plaintiff is a certain new materials group company from Guangdong (Company A), and the defendants are Mr. Li and Chengdu certain industrial company (Company B), with the case being a contract dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 23 of the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China: If a company’s shareholders abuse the independent legal person status of the company and the limited liability of the shareholders to evade debts, causing serious harm to the interests of the company’s creditors, they shall bear joint and several liability for the company’s debts. If a shareholder uses two or more companies under its control to commit the acts specified in the preceding paragraph, each of the companies shall bear joint and several liability for the debts of any one of the companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-facts-of-the-case&#34;&gt;Basic Facts of the Case 
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff, Company A, claims that Defendant Mr. Li collected a “deposit” of 20 million yuan on behalf of Defendant Company B, and requests both defendants to return the principal of 20 million yuan and its interest after the contract expires. Defendant Company B argues that the 20 million yuan claimed by the plaintiff as a “deposit” has no factual or legal basis. The 20 million yuan is a one-time economic compensation paid by Plaintiff Company A to Defendant Company B based on the provisions of the “Memorandum,” and the plaintiff has no right to request its return. Defendant Mr. Li argues that the money he collected from the plaintiff was on behalf of Defendant Company B, and he should not bear any personal responsibility. Upon trial, it was found that on July 31, 2018, Defendant Mr. Li, on behalf of Defendant Company B, signed a “Memorandum” with the plaintiff, reaching an agreement on the cooperation of the pipe equipment automation order project: 1. Party A (Company B) agrees to limit sales to three parties (including domestic and international) within three years; 2. Party A shall provide comprehensive free services within three years, including training personnel, workshop layout, etc.; 3. Equipment spare parts shall be provided free of charge for one year, and spare parts at a low price thereafter until the plaintiff has mastered them; 4. Party B (plaintiff) shall have priority in enjoying the new products developed by Party A; 5. Party B shall place orders for all equipment from Party A at the same price within three years. On the same day, the plaintiff and Defendant Company B signed three “Order Contracts,” stipulating that the plaintiff shall order equipment from Company B, and the contract shall take effect upon payment of a 30% deposit. On August 1, 2018, Defendant Mr. Li issued a receipt to the plaintiff, stating “I have received a payment of 20 million yuan from Guangdong certain new materials group company for equipment.” Later, Mr. Li provided his personal bank account information for payment via WeChat to the plaintiff. On August 8, 2018, the plaintiff transferred 20 million yuan to the personal account provided by Defendant Mr. Li, noting it as payment for goods. At the same time, the plaintiff transferred the deposit for the above three contracts to the designated account of Defendant Company B using its company account. On that day, the plaintiff informed Mr. Li via WeChat that the equipment deposit of 674.88 yuan and 20 million yuan had been paid, and requested him to check. From 2018 to 2021, the plaintiff and Defendant Company B successively signed seven contracts, with a total contract amount of about 22 million yuan; during this period, they also involved matters such as the plaintiff commissioning Company B to purchase other equipment. In the lawsuit, both parties confirmed that except for the 20 million yuan in question, the rights and obligations stipulated in the “Order Contracts” had been performed or settled by agreement. During the transaction between the two parties, except for the receipt dated August 1, 2018, and the WeChat chat record dated August 8, 2018, there were no other written materials or chat records involving the 20 million yuan in question. It was found that Defendant Mr. Li was one of the shareholders of Defendant Company B and also the legal representative of the company; the personal account he used to collect the 20 million yuan in question was also used for the daily business income and expenses of Defendant Company B and Mr. Li’s personal income and expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disposition-of-the-case&#34;&gt;Disposition of the Case
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first-instance court rendered a judgment on April 26, 2023, ordering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendant Company B shall, within ten days of the effective date of this judgment, return 20 million yuan and its interest (calculated at the one-year loan market quoted rate published by the National Interbank Funding Center from January 5, 2023, until the actual date of return) to Plaintiff Company A;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendant Mr. Li shall bear joint and several liability for the aforementioned debt of Defendant Company B;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other claims of Plaintiff Company A are rejected. Both defendants were dissatisfied and filed an appeal. The second-instance court rendered a final judgment on November 1, 2023, upholding the original judgment and rejecting the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-from-the-case&#34;&gt;Lessons from the Case
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the details of the case, it is evident that the plaintiff made a payment of 20 million yuan based solely on a receipt from the legal representative of the counterparty in the contract, and the purpose of the funds mentioned on the receipt and noted on the remittance slip (payment for goods) was inconsistent with the plaintiff’s assertion in the lawsuit (deposit). Moreover, the WeChat conversations between the parties did not clearly specify the nature of the 20 million yuan, and neither the “Memorandum” nor the “Purchase and Sale Contract” mentioned it at all. This means that the plaintiff’s assertion that the 20 million yuan was a “deposit” is not directly proven by evidence. On the other hand, the defense and evidence presented by the defendants, claiming that the 20 million yuan was compensation for the patent technology or other services provided by them, combined with the specific content of the “Memorandum” signed by both parties, has a certain credibility. Therefore, whether the plaintiff can successfully recover the 20 million yuan in question is actually subject to significant litigation risks. The risks arise from the plaintiff’s pursuit of the convenience and efficiency of commercial transactions while neglecting the certainty and safety of such transactions. The court, after examining the statements of both the plaintiff and the defendant and analyzing the strength of their evidence, ultimately ruled in favor of the plaintiff company based on the preponderance of evidence. Additionally, in this case, Defendant Company B’s use of shareholder Mr. Li’s personal account for business operations is a common and prominent issue in commercial activities. Such actions blur the distinction between the personal property of the shareholder and the company’s property, undermining the corporate legal person’s statutory and necessary property independence, and thereby damaging the legitimate rights and interests of the company’s creditors. Therefore, Article 20, Paragraph 3 of the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China stipulates that if a company’s shareholders abuse the independent legal person status of the company and the limited liability of the shareholders to evade debts, causing serious harm to the interests of the company’s creditors, they shall bear joint and several liability for the company’s debts. Based on this, the court ordered Defendant Mr. Li to bear joint and several liability for Defendant Company B’s debt to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the plaintiff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-insights&#34;&gt;Research Insights
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is a common commercial contract dispute for small and medium-sized enterprises. The court, in a situation where both the plaintiff and the defendant held their own grounds, ruled for the defendant to return the funds based on the preponderance of evidence established after review. particularly, the court ordered the shareholder to bear joint and several liability when the defendant company’s assets were mixed with the personal property of the shareholder. This not only effectively protected the plaintiff’s litigious rights but also served as a typical example for enterprises and shareholders engaged in similar behaviors. Additionally, although the plaintiff ultimately won the lawsuit, the legal risks in the governance process of the plaintiff company are still worth noting. While pursuing business efficiency, enterprises should not neglect the certainty and safety of transactions. When conducting large-sum financial transactions, it is necessary to ensure that contract terms are clear and that the purpose of the funds is consistent with the contract content; a standardized retention mechanism should be established for evidence such as contracts, receipts, bank transfer records, and communication records during transactions, to be prepared for future needs; pre-emptive measures should be strengthened to prevent commercial legal risks, and compliance audits should be conducted for important business actions to ensure the legality of the actions and the integrity of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/recently-i-was-very-lucky-to-have-an-article-published-in-the-legal-daily/images/Screenshot_20231019_225757-1.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Recently I was very lucky to have an article published in the Legal Daily" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my first time having an article published in the &amp;ldquo;Legal Daily.&amp;rdquo; The &amp;ldquo;Legal Daily&amp;rdquo; is the most important mainstream media in the field of democratic rule of law in China. It is the largest legal information provider and the most influential professional legal media group in China. It was renamed from the &amp;ldquo;Legal System Daily&amp;rdquo; in 2020. Being able to have an article published in this newspaper can be considered a fortunate coincidence and a very rare opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I started working, I have published many articles in various newspapers and magazines, including the &amp;ldquo;Changan&amp;rdquo; magazine of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the &amp;ldquo;Democracy and Rule of Law&amp;rdquo; weekly of the China Law Society, the &amp;ldquo;Democracy and Rule of Law&amp;rdquo; newspaper, the &amp;ldquo;Southern Daily&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Southern Rule of Law Report&amp;rdquo; in Guangdong Province, as well as our local &amp;ldquo;Foshan Daily&amp;rdquo; and various internal publications. Today, while chatting with a friend on WeChat, I talked about my past experience in writing, and I realized that writing is not as difficult as I thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal Daily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before entering my current position in August 2014, I had never published any articles in mainstream media. Many of the work summaries and materials in my previous job were simply copied from colleagues&amp;rsquo; work reports found on search engines, with slight modifications to complete the tasks. At that time, I had no concept of writing formal and serious articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the writing standards of government documents, we need to write in Microsoft Office or WPS Office using A4 paper format, and there are strict formatting requirements. For example, the margins should be 3.7 cm at the top, 3.5 cm at the bottom, 2.8 cm on the left, and 2.6 cm on the right. The title of the article must be written in the second font size using the FangZheng XiaoBiao Song font. The content of the article must use the third font size with the FangZheng FangSong-GB2312 font. The first-level headings must use the third font size in bold, and the second-level headings must use the third font size in bold with the Kai font. There are also specific requirements for line spacing and paragraphs, including the maximum number of characters per line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I started writing, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know all of this. I was used to using code editors like VSCode or Notepad++ for writing, and I saved files in TXT format. I felt that the characters in code editors were smaller, making it easier to read directly on the screen, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about text formatting. Additionally, I used the WordPad application in Windows for writing. I still have many RTF files saved on my office computer to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the content formatting of the article was adjusted, I used to like saving files in the XPS format in Windows. Many of my colleagues&amp;rsquo; computers didn&amp;rsquo;t have PDF readers installed at that time, but XPS readers were built-in on Windows and could be opened without the need for additional software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I published an article in a formal magazine was in September 2014, which was about a month after I started my current position. It was published in an internal publication called &amp;ldquo;Foshan Research.&amp;rdquo; The file versions that I still have on my computer are in the XPS format that was used back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Chinese government agencies, one important factor in evaluating the quality of work is whether it has received positive coverage in mainstream media or has been recommended and reprinted as an exemplary case in internal publications. Therefore, many government departments prioritize hiring staff who are skilled in writing articles. Sometimes, similar to the publication fees required for many academic papers, some government agencies have to allocate specific funds to publish positive articles in mainstream media. However, in all my years of work, I have never had to spend money to publish an article in this way because the department I work for simply does not have that budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democracy and Legal Magazine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To effectively publish articles in mainstream media, here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of my own experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first point is to stay up-to-date with current affairs. For example, in 2017, I published an article in &amp;ldquo;Chang&amp;rsquo;an&amp;rdquo; magazine focusing on strengthening the protection of the rights of young people. At that time, there were several severe criminal cases targeting minors in China. I analyzed the causes of those cases and combined them with effective local practices and experiences in protecting minors, providing targeted suggestions and recommendations. After I sent the article to the editor-in-chief&amp;rsquo;s email at the magazine, it was quickly accepted and published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second point is to maintain a friendly relationship with journalists and editors if you aim to publish articles in a specific publication on an ongoing basis. For instance, over the years, I have maintained a very friendly relationship with the Guangdong Journalist Station of Democracy and Legal News Agency, frequently communicating with them about the current topics they are focusing on. Based on their needs, I see if I can provide relevant news leads and materials. If there is a suitable article, it is usually easier to get it published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third point is to consider the length of the article before submission and provide appropriate versions accordingly. For example, before publishing an article in the &amp;ldquo;Legal Daily,&amp;rdquo; I carefully studied the layout and length requirements of the newspaper. Generally, they accept articles of 2500, 1500, 800, or 200 words. Before being sure if the article would be accepted, I prepared four different versions of the article corresponding to these lengths. This way, if the editor decides to use the article, they don&amp;rsquo;t need to make further edits or modifications, saving them time in typesetting. Luckily, they chose the 2500-word version I provided this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, it is quite fulfilling to publish articles in mainstream media during one&amp;rsquo;s spare time. These articles are usually permanently preserved and can be found in serious academic and journal databases. They are also easily searchable on search engines, leaving a lasting memory for oneself in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>A wonderful experience working in the procuratorate</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/a-wonderful-experience-working-in-the-procuratorate/images/IMG_20230909_184227.jpg" alt="Featured image of post A wonderful experience working in the procuratorate" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was very honored to go to the procuratorate of a city as the leader of a working group to carry out a special work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our working group consists of 15 people, including senior judges, prosecutors and legal professionals. The main task of the working group is to conduct a comprehensive inspection and evaluation of criminal justice cases handled by courts, procuratorates and public security bureaus throughout the city last year, as well as administrative law enforcement cases handled by government administrative departments such as the Natural Resources Bureau, the Ecology and Environment Bureau, and the Health Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first time working in the procuratorate, and I am deeply impressed by the good working atmosphere and advanced office facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/a-wonderful-experience-working-in-the-procuratorate/images/IMG_20230909_184227-1024x856.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Procuratorate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Constitution of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China, the main duties of the procuratorate are to supervise the implementation of laws, including civil, criminal and administrative proceedings, and have the same status as courts in state institutions. At the same time, the procuratorate is also one of the main participants in criminal proceedings, responsible for supervising the criminal filing and investigation work of the public security organs, prosecuting criminal cases on behalf of the state, supervising the criminal trial work of the courts, and proposing public interest litigation on behalf of the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2018 reform of state institutions, the functions of the procuratorate were somewhat weakened. After 2018, most of the investigation responsibilities for job-related crimes were transferred to the National Supervision Commission, and the procuratorate only retained the investigation duties for job-related crimes committed by judicial personnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I feel that the procuratorate is a very serious office space, all prosecutors are very smart and intelligent, they are very rigorous and serious in their work, and they are very well managed on many details, otherwise it is difficult to win in the lawyer&amp;rsquo;s nitpicky defense. During this inspection, we saw that most of the criminal cases charged by the procuratorate, including the charges, criminal facts and sentencing recommendations, can be accepted by the court, and more than 80% of criminal suspects can actively admit guilt. The vast majority of criminal cases with unclear facts and insufficient evidence have been rejected by the procuratorate and cannot enter the court trial stage; In a small number of cases, after the prosecution is instituted and before the court begins, because the lawyer discovers that there are obvious problems in the case, the procuratorate will also withdraw the prosecution or modify the prosecution. In the end, less than 10 percent of the verdicts in cases are inconsistent with the content of the procuratorate&amp;rsquo;s prosecution, and once such a case occurs, the procuratorate has special departments and personnel to study these problems, and through repeated study and discussion, try to avoid the continuation of such problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming a judge or prosecutor is a dream that all of us legal professionals have, but because of the nature of my current job, this idea may never come.I have to say this is a regret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it&amp;rsquo;s not a permanent position, but rather a temporary job lasting only a month, it&amp;rsquo;s still a valuable experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my fourth time working at a court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time was during my sophomore year of college when I interned at a district court near our university for a month, primarily involved in judgment execution work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second time was during my senior year of college when I chose to intern at another district court near our university for three months, also focusing on judgment execution work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last month before graduating from college, I started working at a district court in the city where the university is located (the city has a total of five district courts), where I experienced the first part of my career, which lasted about 18 months. The first three months were the most painful period, because my salary was only 1,700 yuan, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to buy a BlackBerry phone. After that, I passed the exam to become a judicial assistant, although the salary is only about 5,000 yuan, but with other benefits, the total annual income can reach the level of 100,000 yuan.During this time, because of the nature of being an assistant, I did not need to compete with other colleagues in my work, but only needed to complete my own work tasks, so I had a very happy time for more than a year, and it also made me deeply love court work. This period of my career at the Court was also the happiest period of my work and life in all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my work contract from 2011 when I worked at the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it has been eleven years since I last worked at the court, returning this time felt very familiar and nostalgic. For example, due to the confidentiality requirements of many court tasks, the court utilizes a dedicated internal network. As soon as I arrived at the court this time, I immediately found the internal website I used during my previous work at the court and was pleasantly surprised to discover an electronic magazine that I had edited back then. However, this is the only trace I could find of my past work at that court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been quite eventful in the eleven years since I left the court in 2012. Returning to the court has allowed me to see many issues that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of before. There are significant differences between the court I had in mind and the reality I encountered, mainly in a few aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court work environment tends to be more isolated. Due to the relatively independent nature of court work, court personnel often have limited interactions with other government departments and members of society. Their perspectives and problem-solving approaches may differ from those of the general public, leading to a certain degree of social functioning deficit. For example, during this experience, we discovered that some judges were sued by their neighbors due to their inability to handle neighborhood disputes effectively. Others lacked social experience when dealing with simple litigation cases arising from family, school, or workplace conflicts due to their limited participation in social activities. Additionally, some young judges, who assumed judicial roles in their early twenties, lacked personal experience in relationships, marriage, and divorce but had to mediate divorce cases for others, resulting in complaints from the parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a higher proportion of women working in the courts. In China, due to law being categorized as a humanities discipline, there tend to be more female students studying law, while male students mostly choose science and engineering majors. As a result, there is a higher proportion of women working in the courts. In the four courts I have experienced, the proportion of female staff is generally above 60%. In the court I recently visited, among employees born after 1980, approximately 70% are women. It&amp;rsquo;s commonly believed that women are more inclined towards sensitivity in terms of personality, while men lean towards rationality. However, law itself leans towards rationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid growth of litigation cases in the courts is indeed a concerning trend. The current efficiency of the courts, with an average case processing time of 60 days for civil cases and 20 days for criminal cases, has contributed to this increase. Additionally, the low cost of litigation, where most cases are charged at 1% of the claim amount and many cases don&amp;rsquo;t require hiring a lawyer, has made the process more accessible to individuals. It has become as simple as submitting pre-litigation documents and evidence to the court, akin to applying for a visa.These convenient conditions have led to a significant surge in litigation cases in the past decade. In my city, for example, there has been an average of one litigation case for every 30 people annually. It seems that citizens&amp;rsquo; initial inclination when encountering disputes is to file a lawsuit in court.While the accessibility and efficiency of the court system are positive aspects, the rapid growth of litigation cases also highlights the importance of alternative dispute resolution methods. Encouraging mediation and other forms of dispute resolution can help alleviate the burden on the courts and provide more flexible and tailored solutions for the parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese courts have implemented numerous performance indicators. Prior to the year 2000, there were significant incidents of wrongful convictions and miscarriages of justice in Chinese courts, which had a profound negative impact. In the past decade or so, the higher courts have introduced a myriad of performance indicators to ensure the fairness of judgments and balance the judicial process. However, this has also led to a phenomenon where judges prioritize meeting these indicators above all else during case proceedings.For example, in order to curb the rapid growth of litigation cases, the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Court set a target of reducing the number of cases by 5% this year. As a result, many courts have established thresholds at the filing stage, requiring most cases to undergo mediation by judges before proceeding to litigation. If successful, the cases can be resolved without going to trial. However, in reality, the workload of judges has not decreased. On the contrary, the difficulty of mediating many cases has resulted in a significant waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the court is still a highly desirable place of employment. The working atmosphere is harmonious, and the infrastructure and office environment are excellent. However, all of this will come to an end as my current assignment concludes. Fortunately, I will be starting a new job at a different prosecutor&amp;rsquo;s office next month. In China, the courts and prosecutor&amp;rsquo;s offices are relatively independent departments, and they share many similarities.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dispute over Time Nodes in Property Service Contract Cases</title>

        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/dispute-over-time-nodes-in-property-service-contract-cases/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/dispute-over-time-nodes-in-property-service-contract-cases/images/1665824_a36a30d9.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Dispute over Time Nodes in Property Service Contract Cases" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a typical case of property service contract dispute, where the plaintiff is Branch A of a property management company in Shanghai, and the defendants are owners Cao and Guo of a residential community, with the case being a dispute over the property service contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-facts-of-the-case&#34;&gt;Basic Facts of the Case 
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owners Cao and Guo purchased Unit 1302 in a residential community in Foshan City, and accordingly, they signed a “Commercial Property Purchase Contract (Presale)” with the developer and a “Preliminary Property Service Agreement for Foshan City” with Company A, stipulating the terms of property management (abridged): Implementing a bundled fee system for property services (including common area utility costs), with property service fees collected based on a first-tier service standard, paid monthly by the owners according to the area of the property they own, with the payment due on the 5th of each month. The charge for high-rise residential buildings is 2.4 yuan/square meter/month; the parking space charge is 2.4 yuan/square meter/month. If an owner fails to pay the property management service fee as required, they should be urged to make the payment within a limited period, and if they still do not pay after the deadline, the owners’ committee or the property service company may publish the collection status of property service fees within the property management area, naming the owners who owe fees and their building and unit numbers for collection; if payment is still not made, legal action may be taken in the people’s court. Article 11 of the “Commercial Property Purchase Contract (Presale)” stipulates the handover date as June 30, 2021. The building involved in this case was completed and registered for acceptance on December 31, 2020. Cao and Guo received the acceptance notice and went to inspect the property on July 2, 2021, but did not complete the acceptance procedures; they later accepted the property on June 8, 2022. The property involved in the case had already been registered for real estate on April 20, 2022. Company A believes that Cao and Guo owe property service fees amounting to 3,039.37 yuan from June 30, 2021, to August 31, 2022, and filed a lawsuit after issuing a demand notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disposition-of-the-case&#34;&gt;Disposition of the Case
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court ruled that owners Cao and Guo shall, within ten days of the effective date of the judgment, pay property service fees amounting to 3,039.37 yuan to the plaintiff Company A; other claims of the plaintiff were rejected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;case-insights&#34;&gt;Case Insights
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “two-faced” phenomenon is prevalent in the provision of services by property management companies. When entering into a property service agreement, the property management company promises a higher level of service to the owners (construction units) or the owners’ committee and agrees on the corresponding level of service charge standards. However, the actual property services provided cannot match the level of the charges, with a significant disconnect, which is referred to by owners as “high charges and low services.” In litigation, no evidence of service levels is provided, and the contract does not stipulate or stipulates a too high penalty for breach of contract, which is clearly insufficient to justify the request for the penalty from the people’s court. Low service levels also indicate that the property management company itself is in breach of contract. In cases of mutual breach, the court only supports the basic property management fees, which is more fair and reasonable. Therefore, property management companies should take this case as a lesson to reflect on themselves, strive to improve their own service levels, and then fulfill their burden of proof to reduce unpaid fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For owners, they should also clarify the parties to the contract and the responsible parties. Owners should not conflate the responsibilities of the developers and the property management companies. If the owner acknowledges receiving the acceptance notice and has inspected the property, but did not find any defects involving the main structure or safety quality issues, the property meets the agreed delivery standards, and the delivery notice is binding on the owner. If the owner finds defects that require general repairs or the gas pipelines are not yet opened upon receiving the property, the contract only stipulates the developer’s obligations for repairs and remedies, and does not grant the owner the right to refuse to accept the property, nor can it be used as a reason to refuse to pay property management fees. Owners must clearly understand the rights and obligations. Because the repair of the exclusive portion is a contractual dispute between them and the developer, and has nothing to do with the property management company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of pre-sale property disputes arising during the transaction of new residential properties is a common civil dispute. In such cases, due to the different responsibility and obligation relationships between the owners, property management companies, and developers, as well as the different legal effects arising from the time nodes such as the signing of the pre-sale contract, inspection and acceptance of the property, and real estate registration, owners often find it difficult to accurately define the boundaries of their own rights and obligations, and it is also easy for property management companies to have the “high charges and low services” phenomenon. This case has certain typical significance for promoting the standardized services of property management companies and for owners to perform their legal obligations and standardize their rights protection behaviors according to the law.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rule of law and institutions</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/rule-of-law-and-institutions/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/rule-of-law-and-institutions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/rule-of-law-and-institutions/images/146362_ec6ba4c5fe453330bdafc1bc881690ef-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post Rule of law and institutions" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having nothing to do today, I found a copy of the political gains and losses in China written by Qian Mu from the bookshelf. The content of the book was written in the 1950s. The usage of some historical terms is slightly different from that in contemporary China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to be regarded as feudalism, but in the modern division, the Qin Dynasty is the beginning of feudalism. For example, in the book, in order to solve the contradiction between private land ownership and taxation, the Han Dynasty mentioned that Dong Zhongshu restricted the large-scale concentration of land, and Wang Mang Then the method of equalizing the fields was directly used, which resulted in failure. Wang Mang&amp;rsquo;s land equalization was not the only one in history. The Revolution of 1911 also proposed the establishment of the Republic of China and the equalization of land rights. Of course, he did not actually do it. In the end, this great problem of thousands of years was completely realized in the Deng Xiaoping era, and the corresponding poll tax and agricultural tax were also completely ended in the Wen Jiabao era. This may also be after the founding of New China. The biggest change to our basic institutions in 2,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We summarize the above-mentioned economic policies of the Han Dynasty. For industry and commerce, it is close to advocating the so-called restraint of capital. In terms of land rent for farmers, it has also achieved light labor and light taxes, but it has not equalized land rights. . During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Dong Zhongshu once advocated the policy of restricting land. Even if the acres of land in the country cannot be distributed equally, there must be a maximum limit so that each landlord cannot exceed the limit of a thousand acres. Unfortunately, even this policy has not been implemented. So when Wang Mang got up, he aroused a major reform, and all the land was nationalized, called Huangtian, and redistributed. The idea at the time was to restore the well field system of the feudal era, but the result was a major disturbance. Wang Mang failed, and there has been no thorough reform of the land system in Chinese history since then. ‬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is divided into five parts: Han, Tang, Song, Ming and Qing. Due to time constraints, I only read the first part of the Han Dynasty. For the rest of the time, I watched a recent eight-episode documentary called Qiangjun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast. China&amp;rsquo;s political system for more than 2,000 years has actually been finalized very early, including many of our current systems, which were already applicable before the Qin and Han Dynasties. The biggest problem is that after the New Culture Movement and the dilapidation of the Cultural Revolution, contemporary education has an overly negative evaluation of the imperial dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political system of China&amp;rsquo;s past dynasties cannot be separated from two core issues, one is the relationship between the first and second leaders, and the other is the relationship between the central government and the local government. For example, in the Han Dynasty, the first leader was the emperor, and the second leader was the prime minister. The power of the emperor is mainly embodied by the six books in charge of food and daily life, while the power of the prime minister is embodied in various government agencies. In fact, it is very close to the state form of modern constitutional monarchy. There is a strict distinction between imperial power and government. The problem is that. This good institutional model is only continued through customary law, and has not risen to the framework of statutory law, resulting in very different effects in different emperors&amp;rsquo; reigns. Some emperors have outstanding abilities and must do everything by themselves, so the prime minister has no room to use his skills. The imperial power and the government have become one, and they have become the de facto home world. Some emperors are willing to inherit the ancient system, the imperial power and regime are highly differentiated, and professional bureaucrats can exert their maximum effectiveness. This is also a reference for observing the political situation in the past 20 years. And such a system that the main local bureaucrats cannot be held by local people was unexpectedly established in the Han Dynasty, and the original intention was to prevent problems caused by excessive local power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentary talks about the reform of the military in recent years, which is actually a process of destroying the old and establishing the new, and the system must ultimately be implemented by people. Throughout the Chinese dynasties, there has been a mass mentality of respecting the virtuous but not the public. There is no democratic soil. Only a virtuous monarch can lead the people to prosperity. The era of stagnation and retrogression must be due to the emergence of corrupt leaders. This kind of system design is estimated to continue for a long time, and the public will buy it, and they will always think that this is definitely not a problem with the system at the top, but a problem with the implementation at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qian Mu mentioned in the book that it is impossible for any system to be implemented for one or two hundred years without changing, because the people who implement the system are always changing. This point still needs to be further understood. The framework of the rule of law will not be achieved overnight, and self-healing ability is too important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added on October 10th:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a deep understanding of history. Except for a certain understanding of Chinese history in middle school history books more than ten years ago, I have basically never touched it in the rest of the time. When I saw this book, I saw it by chance in a bookstore and thought it was quite thin, so I bought it. It has been placed on the bookshelf for several years, and just in time for the National Day holiday, I pulled it out and looked through it when I had time. I have also bought some other history books, almost all of which are more than hundreds of thousands of words, and I have never read them. After reading this book, there are three main impressions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answers to many years of doubts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book explains very thoroughly the relationship between imperial power and the government in Chinese history. It can be said that after so many years of socialist history education, I have always mistakenly believed that the emperor is arbitrary and has the final say. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect that there would be a practice similar to the constitutional monarchy in the Han Dynasty, and the imperial power would have so many constraints. Secondly, the book explains very clearly the origin, development and reform of many political, military, household registration and taxation systems. I have a more systematic understanding of Chinese history, and my impression of imperial dynasties has also changed a lot. I am even more amazed The ancients were able to design such a sophisticated political system more than 2,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new understanding of the relationship between personnel and systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my work, I often talk about the need to set up various systems to make the work more standardized, let the system restrain people, and hope that the system can solve the problem once and for all. However, in practice, there are indeed huge contrasts when different personnel operate the same system. This book lists many examples of system failure caused by changes in the times and personnel changes, highlighting the core issue of system self-healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strict distinction should be made between opinions on history and opinions on the times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we evaluate many historical events and characters, we often involuntarily apply the contemporary social environment and values, and always hope to judge from the perspective of God or from a position that we think is neutral. But in the end, the historical characters or events Whether it is good or bad, we should mainly follow the opinions of the people at that time, and it would be very immoral and meaningless to evaluate it out of that environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/briefings-of-integrated-law-enforcement-work-in-parts-of-the-country/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/briefings-of-integrated-law-enforcement-work-in-parts-of-the-country/images/R-C-1.png" alt="Featured image of post Briefings on the area of integrated law enforcement work in parts of the country" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, the local government is investigating work reforms in the field of comprehensive law enforcement, but there are still many questions in various aspects. I searched for practices in other places along the way, and briefly formed a brief introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of comprehensive administrative law enforcement reform, local experience is mainly limited to comprehensive law enforcement in areas such as urban management, cultural markets, agricultural resources, and transportation. So far, no experience has been found to unify all or most of the administrative law enforcement powers to establish &amp;ldquo;unified administrative law enforcement.&amp;rdquo; Jiaozhou City, Qingdao is piloting the reform of the comprehensive administrative law enforcement system, but it is currently limited to the exercise of all administrative law enforcement powers at the township level, and no specific practice has been promoted at the county level or above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of implementing a unified platform for accepting and handling administrative law enforcement, currently more mature representative practices include the &amp;ldquo;Fujian Provincial Online Administrative Law Enforcement Platform&amp;rdquo; with a complex difficulty model, the &amp;ldquo;Qiqihar City Administrative Law Enforcement Platform&amp;rdquo; with a simple difficulty model, and the &amp;ldquo;Ningbo City Administrative Law Enforcement Online Platform&amp;rdquo;. Service Hall&amp;quot;, etc. Among them, the experience of Fujian Province is to build a unified electronic network information platform for the whole province. All administrative actions and supervision work are carried out on the platform, including a unified platform for accepting, handling and supervising administrative law enforcement in the whole province; the experience of Qiqihar City is to build a unified The acceptance and information publicity platform does not involve case handling and transfer work; Ningbo City’s experience is to build a unified information publicity platform to publicize the progress and results of all administrative law enforcement actions in the city and accept public supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is an introduction to the specific situation of comprehensive law enforcement in some regions in China:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comprehensive-law-enforcement-work-reform-in-jiaozhou-city&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive law enforcement work reform in Jiaozhou City:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2013, Shandong Province carried out comprehensive administrative law enforcement reform pilots in eight towns (streets) in Jiaozhou City. Under the condition of unchanged organizational structure, the joint law enforcement model was mainly used to promote the integrated comprehensive law enforcement reform of cities, towns (streets) .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city has integrated law enforcement functions and implemented centralized law enforcement. At the municipal level, the powers of law enforcement in the eight fields of urban management, land management, environmental protection, production safety, food safety, public security management, cultural management, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, which are scattered in various departments directly under the city, will be concentrated in the proposed comprehensive administrative law enforcement At the township level, integrate the town (street) urban management squadron, safety supervision office, land office and other law enforcement agencies, establish a comprehensive law enforcement squadron, implement a dual management system between the city and the town, focus on town (street) management, and enforce the law by The town (street) is deployed in a unified manner, and the responsibility for law enforcement is assumed by the town (street), and the business is guided by the competent department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concentrate law enforcement powers at the county and township levels, and set up comprehensive law enforcement departments respectively, so as to advance the concept of comprehensive law enforcement from the township level to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personnel of the comprehensive law enforcement department at the township level are stationed by the law enforcement department at the county level, and their administrative actions need to be reviewed by the law enforcement department at the county level before they become effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;insufficient&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insufficient:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reform has now integrated the law enforcement power at the township level, but it has not yet been substantially advanced at the county level, and has not involved areas such as unified platforms and supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fujian-online-administrative-law-enforcement-platform&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fujian Online Administrative Law Enforcement Platform:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2011, Fujian Province launched the construction of a provincial-level online administrative law enforcement platform. Based on the provincial online administrative examination and approval system and the online examination and approval electronic monitoring system, relying on the existing resources of the provincial government affairs intranet, extranet and digital Fujian, the platform focuses on administrative punishment and takes into account other administrative actions. Based on the principle of practicality and practicality, a provincial-level integrated administrative law enforcement online operation mechanism has been constructed. The platform can realize the online operation and processing of administrative approval and administrative punishment, and accept online electronic supervision. It can meet the needs of the public to inquire about the handling of administrative matters in real time, the needs of the staff of law enforcement agencies to conduct online administrative law enforcement, and the real-time remote supervision needs of the legal system and efficiency supervision departments for administrative law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promotion process of the platform is mainly divided into five steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**One is to make a list of powers.**Comprehensively sort out relevant laws, regulations and rules, further clarify the basis, conditions, standards and procedures for the establishment of powers, compile a catalog of administrative powers, and list powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**The second is to clarify the power of discretion.**On the basis of clearing and confirming rights, focus on the refinement and quantification of the scope, conditions, and standards of various administrative enforcement powers, such as the scope, conditions, and standards, that have flexible space, and set limits by file, clarify administrative discretion standards, and reduce the discretionary space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**The third is R&amp;amp;D design and the establishment of a unified platform.**The platform is mainly composed of three parts: the online administrative law enforcement service hall, the online administrative law enforcement business handling system and the online administrative law enforcement electronic monitoring system. Early warning and error correction and performance evaluation and other functions. The online administrative law enforcement service hall relies on the Internet to disclose the legal basis, punishment standards, punishment results and basic information of law enforcement personnel to the public, so as to facilitate public supervision and complaints; the online administrative law enforcement business handling system is set up on the government affairs intranet to realize the handling of law enforcement cases The entire process of registration, case filing, investigation, enforcement, case closure, and reconsideration is handled electronically; the online administrative law enforcement electronic monitoring system is set up on the government affairs intranet, mainly to monitor the entire process of online administrative law enforcement behavior. The online administrative law enforcement platform is divided into provinces, cities, and counties. Through unified interface standards and unified data exchange formats, the interconnection and interoperability of the provincial, city, and county platforms will be realized, and data sharing, business collaboration, law enforcement norms, and supervision will eventually be formed. A powerful platform for online law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**The fourth is to implement electronic simultaneous monitoring.**On the online administrative law enforcement platform, four functions are established, including business process records of administrative law enforcement cases, traces of modification of illegal facts, multi-directional electronic monitoring and multi-dimensional statistical reports, so as to effectively manage the links and processes of case handling and eliminate the interference of human factors . In the process of handling law enforcement cases, through integrated supervision methods such as case process supervision, time limit supervision, abnormal case supervision, penalty result supervision, defect case supervision, etc., the whole process and all-round supervision of law enforcement behaviors are realized. At the same time, using the interconnection of online administrative law enforcement platforms, law enforcement departments at the provincial, city, and county levels can supervise the entire process of case handling, and legal institutions, administrative supervision and other departments can also supervise the entire process of law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Fifth, expand the scope of application and improve service functions.**While promoting the construction of an online administrative law enforcement platform, Fujian Province is vigorously building an online platform for the sunny operation of administrative power, which includes administrative approval, administrative law enforcement, public resource transactions, and electronic supervision. Administrative penalties have been extended to government procurement, land transfer, property rights transactions, construction projects and other fields, realizing the transformation from simple administrative functions to comprehensive government services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administrative law enforcement platform is the earliest, largest, most complex and most complete administrative law enforcement platform system in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system fully integrates key functions such as online law enforcement services, law enforcement business handling, and electronic monitoring, and the information sharing mechanism of &amp;ldquo;connection of two laws&amp;rdquo; can be directly realized on this platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;insufficient-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insufficient:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The construction of this system is too difficult for the grassroots, and it needs to be promoted by the province and city to be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;qiqihar-city-administrative-law-enforcement-platform&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qiqihar City Administrative Law Enforcement Platform:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Qiqihar City Administrative Law Enforcement Platform was officially launched on June 13, 2012. The platform has a total of 5 columns, including the disclosure of law enforcement, the law enforcement plan of administrative law enforcement departments, the reporting of administrative law enforcement, the inquiry of administrative punishment, and the supervision of administrative law enforcement effectiveness. At the same time, in order to ensure the orderly and effective operation of the law enforcement platform, the Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection has formulated management and assessment methods to assess the relevant law enforcement departments of the municipal government. In addition, the system has also adopted the method of pilot promotion, and the first batch of 11 administrative law enforcement departments opened the platform. It is understood that the administrative law enforcement platform will take several months from planning to establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;features&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unified acceptance platform. The reporting information is assigned by the background staff of the system to various functional departments for processing. After more than two years of operation, the reporting platform currently handles 285 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unified publicity platform. The system publicizes the law enforcement plans and administrative punishments of various administrative law enforcement departments, which can be queried at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unified supervision platform. In the operation of the system, the discipline inspection and supervision agencies are involved in the whole process, and the administrative efficiency supervision module is combined with the system, which can supervise and report administrative efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;insufficient-2&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insufficient:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is mainly used for the collection and transfer of complaints and the disclosure of punishment information, and does not integrate the case handling background and entity case supervision mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ningbo-administrative-law-enforcement-online-service-hall&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ningbo Administrative Law Enforcement Online Service Hall:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2012, Ningbo City established an online service hall for administrative law enforcement at the city and county levels to make public all administrative punishment cases, from the acceptance of the case to the end of the case, and the entire law enforcement process and supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online service hall was established by the supervision department of the Ningbo Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection, and its system consists of &amp;ldquo;two databases, two networks and two systems&amp;rdquo;. The administrative penalty discretionary database and administrative law enforcement law database in the system include the administrative penalty discretionary power of 40 law enforcement departments in the city. According to different circumstances, there are different grades and corresponding penalty types and punishment ranges. Penalties are refined and quantified There are 10,583 grades, and 3,348 national, provincial and municipal departments are included for inquiries by administrative law enforcement departments and the public. The administrative law enforcement special network, administrative law enforcement service hall network, law enforcement business system, and electronic monitoring system in the system will clearly present the whole process of each administrative law enforcement. Objects of punishment and other citizens, legal persons and organizations can log on to the website of the Administrative Law Enforcement Service Hall to inquire about discretionary power, the qualification certificate number of law enforcement personnel, publication and inquiry of punishment results, complaints and reports, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire handling process and results of all administrative punishment cases will be made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;insufficient-3&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insufficient:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system only integrates and releases the law enforcement information of various departments, and does not establish a unified acceptance and diversion platform, and the system only supports the public to report and complain about illegal or violations that occur during the law enforcement process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zibo-city-unified-administrative-law-enforcement-supervision-network-operation-platform&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zibo City Unified Administrative Law Enforcement Supervision Network Operation Platform:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to standardize the handling of administrative cases and administrative discretion, Zibo proposed in April 2014 to establish a unified network operation platform for administrative law enforcement supervision in the city. Zibo&amp;rsquo;s administrative law enforcement supervision network operation platform implements the integrated construction of district, county and city government departments, which are carried out simultaneously and share one platform to realize online case handling, online supervision, and online services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city plans to standardize the law enforcement process, refine the standards, improve the system, and operate online to realize the standardization, informationization, openness, real-time supervision and comprehensive coverage of the administrative punishment power, so as to ensure the lawful, standardized, open and reasonable exercise of the administrative punishment power . All the data of the administrative penalty subject database, administrative law enforcement personnel database, law enforcement basis law enforcement matter database and administrative penalty discretion benchmark database are implanted into the city&amp;rsquo;s unified administrative law enforcement supervision network operation system, and an administrative penalty matter coding management mechanism is established to solidify the law enforcement process. Except for public security, taxation, customs, commodity inspection and the People&amp;rsquo;s Bank of China, all administrative law enforcement departments&amp;rsquo; punishment cases must be handled on the city&amp;rsquo;s unified administrative law enforcement supervision network platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city will make overall planning, and the two levels of government will simultaneously establish a platform for administrative law enforcement and administrative supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for specific fields, the handling and transfer of administrative cases are carried out on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;insufficient-4&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insufficient&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The platform has not yet been built, and the city is currently carrying out the &amp;ldquo;Administrative Law Enforcement Standardization Construction Year&amp;rdquo; campaign, and it will take time to unify the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;yiwu-unified-complaint-and-reporting-platform-for-administrative-law-enforcement&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yiwu unified complaint and reporting platform for administrative law enforcement:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the Yiwu Municipal Government promoted the Commission for Disciplinary Inspection, the Procuratorate and other departments to integrate the complaints, reports, and consultation telephones of the original 74 departments in Yiwu into 96150, making it a unified complaints and reports platform for administrative law enforcement in Yiwu. The platform is affiliated with the convenience service center of the municipal government and exists independently of the administrative law enforcement department, which provides a solid foundation for the implementation of the inspection agency&amp;rsquo;s law enforcement supervision power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform management center will dispatch the complaints and reports received to the relevant law enforcement and administrative responsible units through the network in the form of business orders according to the division of functions. The center will give feedback to the report and complaint consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;features-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;features&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish a unified administrative law enforcement complaint platform in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform management department is independent from the administrative department, which is convenient for supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;insufficient-5&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insufficient&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is only a telephone acceptance platform.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/perspective-the-first-of-the-central-decision-on-promoting-the-rule-of-law/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/perspective-the-first-of-the-central-decision-on-promoting-the-rule-of-law/images/cd3cafe5-fde9-4dfc-a2b5-cce58f6a1034-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post From a personal perspective, I interpret the first of the Central Decision on Promoting the Rule of Law" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, our Party issued the &amp;ldquo;Decision of the Central Committee on Several Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Promoting the Rule of Law&amp;rdquo;. The full text has more than 16,000 words. Due to time constraints, let&amp;rsquo;s go section by section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-is-the-paragraph-most-closely-related-to-personal-work&#34;&gt;The first is the paragraph most closely related to personal work:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political and legal committee is the organizational form for the party committee to lead the political and legal work, and it must be persisted for a long time. Political and legal committees of party committees at all levels should focus their work on grasping the political direction, coordinating the functions of all parties, coordinating political and legal work, building political and legal teams, supervising the performance of duties in accordance with the law, creating a fair judicial environment, taking the lead in handling affairs according to the law, and ensuring the correct and unified implementation of the Constitution and laws . The party organizations of political and legal organs must establish and improve a system for reporting major matters to the party committee. Strengthen the party building of political and legal organs, and give full play to the political guarantee role of party organizations and the vanguard and exemplary role of party members in the construction of the rule of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been folk rumors that since Master Kong stepped down, the status of the Political and Legal Committee has plummeted, and it will even be revoked. But the result was just the opposite. This time, the central government vigorously seized power, using the Political and Legal Committee as the starting point, and continued to firmly control the various political and legal departments. And the leadership level of the Political and Legal Committee was raised from the central government to be directly controlled by the top leader, so as to avoid the situation where power is out of control again. To a certain extent, it reflects the style of the hawks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eyes of many scholars, the Political and Legal Committee is the source of the lack of separation between the party and the government, and the party&amp;rsquo;s use of the party to disrupt the law. The Political and Legal Committee randomly guides the public prosecutors to handle cases and intervenes in individual cases. It is one of the chief culprits that deteriorate the legal environment and create unjust, false and wrong cases. But in fact, judging from my work experience in the courts, public security, judiciary, and political and legal committees of the political and legal system in recent years, these accusations by scholars or folks seem to be caused by a one-size-fits-all problem. In the words of a vice-president during the investigation of a certain court two days ago: &amp;ldquo;Blindly directing cases and interfering in trials are things that can only be done by bumpkins in poor areas in the interior.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Xiaohe, there are many cases like this in your hometown.&amp;rdquo; &amp;quot; &amp;ldquo;How could this kind of thing happen in the Pearl River Delta region, it disappeared ten years ago.&amp;rdquo; Roughness is not rough, I personally agree with the words of the vice president. Although his words are slightly ridiculed, they are consistent with my judgment on the overall situation of the rule of law - the allocation of legal resources between regions Seriously unbalanced and the level of rule of law varies greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my personal point of view, my current work is mainly to coordinate various political and legal agencies to solve practical difficulties, and focus on solving the difficulties of various agencies in handling cases in the field of people&amp;rsquo;s livelihood that are of concern to the masses. Some of these problems involve multiple power departments, and we need to take the lead in coordination; some involve very professional work fields, and we need to study the direction of solving them; some involve major group interests, and we need to create a stable environment for handling cases; Some involve the fundamental interests of the masses, but they cannot be resolved through legal channels. We need to provide assistance and study preventive measures. These are real personal work issues at present, and the decision-making mentioned by the central government is consistent from theory to reality. But the problem is that not every region has the same political and legal environment as my region. Even within the Pearl River Delta, there are still many regions with various problems, and most of the work is in the form, the rule of law environment is not optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;just-like-these-two-paragraphs&#34;&gt;Just like these two paragraphs:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implement the final trial and litigation termination system, implement the separation of appeals and interviews, and ensure that the parties exercise their appeal rights in accordance with the law. For appeals against effective judgments and decisions of judicial organs, the system of representation by lawyers shall be gradually implemented. Complainants who cannot afford a lawyer are included in the scope of legal aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improve the linkage mechanism between administrative law enforcement and criminal justice, improve the standards and procedures for case transfer, establish information sharing, case notification, and case transfer systems for administrative law enforcement agencies, public security organs, procuratorial organs, and judicial organs, and resolutely overcome cases that cannot be transferred and cannot be transferred. , Punishment instead of punishment phenomenon, to achieve a seamless connection between administrative punishment and criminal punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;separation of lawsuits and interviews&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;connection of the two laws&amp;rdquo; mentioned in the middle of these two paragraphs are one of the key tasks of our Political and Legal Committee this year. In the past 10 years, the complaint work has been in a hurry, brewing a large number of mass incidents, major cases, unjust, false and wrongly decided cases, which seriously damaged the credibility of the judiciary and restricted the development of a society ruled by law. The deepening of erroneous ideas such as lawsuits and haunting visits will restrict the development of the rule of law for a long time to come. The &amp;ldquo;separation of complaints and visits&amp;rdquo; is currently the first step in solving this major problem. Although staggering, since the pilot reform of &amp;ldquo;separation of complaints and visits&amp;rdquo; launched by the central government at the end of last year, my region has basically completed the separation of the field of complaints and complaints related to law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Combination of the two laws&amp;rdquo; is an extremely professional field. Due to the unbalanced power development of the government in recent years, various administrative law enforcement powers are overflowing, but the supervision of administrative law enforcement powers is difficult. In the Peng Zhen era, the general supervision power of the procuratorate over administrative agencies was directly rejected, resulting in the long-term inability to obtain independent supervision in the field of administrative law enforcement, which led to a large number of &amp;ldquo;substituting punishment for punishment&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;not punishing the guilty&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;penal money&amp;rdquo; in reality. transaction” phenomenon. It is almost impossible for the general supervision power to be taken back to the procuratorate, but the &amp;ldquo;connection of the two laws&amp;rdquo; is a very important supplementary method, that is, the procuratorate can supervise the law enforcement behavior of the administrative agency in the field of punishment, at least in key areas. The agency&amp;rsquo;s law enforcement behavior has been monitored. But at the same time, &amp;ldquo;connecting the two laws&amp;rdquo; is currently an extremely difficult task. There are tens of millions of administrative law enforcement powers, and the units with law enforcement powers are more powerful than the other. It is completely impossible to rely on the procuratorate to do it alone. Therefore, the local political law The coordinating role played by the Commission is crucial. Some people may have doubts. It is enough for our procuratorate to exercise its procuratorial power in accordance with the law and handle cases independently. Why does Mao need you to coordinate with the Political and Legal Committee? The key point is that even if the procuratorate handles the case itself, in the professional field of &amp;ldquo;connection of the two laws&amp;rdquo;, there are not many prosecutors in China who can handle it. You still have to learn from the beginning, start from the beginning, and move forward step by step. What&amp;rsquo;s more, even if prosecutors can handle cases, the public security has to learn it. The number of public security police is 100 times the number of prosecutors. What&amp;rsquo;s more, there are millions of civil servants who have law enforcement power behind them. It takes several years for the &amp;ldquo;Three Represents&amp;rdquo;, how can it be possible to learn those things in the &amp;ldquo;connection of the two laws&amp;rdquo; in a short time. In the end, everyone doesn&amp;rsquo;t learn, everyone doesn&amp;rsquo;t practice, slack off each other, and the law does not blame the public. It is still the same as before, no progress at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-mode-of-cohesion-of-two-methods-is-as-follows&#34;&gt;The mode of &amp;ldquo;cohesion of two methods&amp;rdquo; is as follows:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the illegal acts discovered by the administrative law enforcement agencies during law enforcement constitute a crime, the case shall be transferred to the public security. The public security examines the cases transferred by the administrative law enforcement agencies. If the conditions are not met, the cases will not be filed. If the cases meet the conditions, they will be investigated and then transferred to the procuratorate. The procuratorate receives the case transferred by the public security, examines and prosecutes it, does not prosecute if it does not meet the conditions, and initiates a public prosecution if it meets the conditions. The court judges and executes according to law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;here-comes-the-problem-there-are-a-lot-of-difficult-problems-in-the-middle-tucao-mode&#34;&gt;Here comes the problem, there are a lot of difficult problems in the middle: (Tucao mode)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. There are tens of thousands of administrative law enforcement powers, and the ability of administrative agencies is limited, so it may not be possible to find that administrative violations constitute crimes; 2. The procuratorate&amp;rsquo;s ability is limited, and it may not be possible to find that the administrative punishment imposed by the administrative agency is &amp;ldquo;replacing punishment with punishment&amp;rdquo;; 3. The capacity of the administrative agency is limited, and it is almost impossible to collect criminal evidence (the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that it can only be done by political and legal agencies); 4. The capacity of the public security organs is limited, and cases with difficult to verify criminal clues or insufficient evidence can only be returned to the administrative organs; 5. When encountering a returned case, the administrative agency does not know how to deal with it. Transfer it, the police refused to accept it, don&amp;rsquo;t transfer it, dereliction of duty. . . 6. The punishment of the administrative agency is fines, detaining certificates, detentions, etc. The evidence requirements are extremely simple, and you can be fined by sticking plasters; 7. The police want to arrest and convict people, and the evidence requirements are extremely strict. The punishment basis provided by your administrative agency is a pile of waste paper; 8. Why did the procuratorate go? The procuratorate didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do. You can&amp;rsquo;t tell me that the procuratorate collects evidence by itself and then submits it to the police, and then let the police transfer it back, and then prosecute. 9. What about the courts? The courts still have headaches. The court still has a bunch of cases of refusal to enforce rulings and judgments waiting to be transferred to the police. My court has determined that this kid refuses to execute, which is already a crime. Whether you will be caught by the police or not. The police arrested him, whether the procuratorate will prosecute him or not, your court said he committed a crime, and my public security department is still making a fuss. Is this a lynching by default?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, things like the independence of the judiciary are still difficult to achieve at present. The coordination function of the party committee still has a strong viability in the current country where the rule of man is still strong, but. . . . Not every local political and legal committee has the ability to promote these tasks. I hope they don&amp;rsquo;t follow in the footsteps of &amp;ldquo;urban management&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The boundary between insult and unlawful detention</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/the-boundary-between-insult-and-unlawful-detention/images/AAP3_M-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post The boundary between insult and unlawful detention" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original text on Weibo: [A woman in Quanzhou entered a store to steal two pieces of bread and was tied to a pole for public display] Southeast Morning Post: On the morning of the 4th, a woman was caught by the shopkeeper on the spot when she stole two pieces of bread on Zhongshan Middle Road, Anhai Town, Jinjiang. In order to warn her and prevent her from committing crimes again, the owner, Mr. Lin, tied the thief to a telephone pole and hung a cardboard with &amp;ldquo;I am a thief&amp;rdquo; on his chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;crime of illegal detention&lt;/strong&gt;, refers to the act of illegally depriving others of their personal freedom by detention, confinement or other coercive methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;insult&lt;/strong&gt;, refers to the use of violence or other methods to openly demean the personality of others, damage the reputation of others, and the circumstances are serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 238: Whoever illegally detains others or deprives others of their personal freedom by other means shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, short-term detention, public surveillance or deprivation of political rights. If there are circumstances of beating or humiliating, a heavier punishment shall be given. Whoever commits the crime mentioned in the preceding paragraph and causes serious injury shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than three years but not more than ten years; and whoever causes death shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than ten years. Whoever uses violence to cause injury, disability or death shall be convicted and punished in accordance with the provisions of Articles 234 and 232 of this Law. Whoever illegally seizes or detains others for the purpose of extorting debts shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of the preceding two paragraphs. State organ functionaries who commit crimes in the preceding three paragraphs by taking advantage of their powers shall be given heavier punishments in accordance with the provisions of the preceding three paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 246 Whoever publicly insults others or fabricates facts to slander others by violence or other means, if the circumstances are serious, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, surveillance or deprivation of political rights. The crimes mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall only be dealt with upon complaint, except for cases that seriously endanger social order and national interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Regulations on the Standards of the People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate for Directly Accepting Cases for Filing and Investigating Cases (Trial)&amp;rdquo; clearly stipulates that the crime of illegal detention must exceed 24 hours. The case should also be filed, that is, &amp;ldquo;illegally detaining others for more than 24 hours&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;illegally detaining others and performing acts of binding, beating, insulting, etc.&amp;rdquo; are objective behavioral manifestations of the crime of illegal detention, and there is no time limit for illegal detention in the latter case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what the motive is, as long as there is the purpose of illegally depriving others of their personal liberty, and the purpose of illegally detaining others is intentional, it constitutes the crime of illegal detention. If the illegal deprivation of personal freedom is for other criminal purposes, the punishment for other crimes is heavier than the crime of illegal detention. should be punished as other crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illegal detention for more than 24 hours has insulting circumstances, and insulting behavior constitutes a crime. This situation should belong to several crimes, and should be punished as the crime of illegal detention and the crime of insulting (or the crime of compulsively insulting women).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the crime of illegal detention, the provisions on &amp;ldquo;heavy punishment if there are circumstances of beating or insulting&amp;rdquo; should not include the situation that illegal detention and insulting behaviors constitute crimes at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;6&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deprivation of liberty must be unlawful. According to the law, the judiciary does not constitute the crime of illegal detention for persons with criminal facts and major suspicions who take compulsory measures such as detention and arrest to restrict personal freedom. However, if it is found that the arrest should not be made, and the person is not released with excuses and continues to be detained, it should be considered as illegal deprivation of personal liberty. For those who are committing crimes or are discovered in time after committing crimes, those who are wanted, those who have escaped from prison, or those who are being hunted down, it is a right, not illegal deprivation of personal freedom. Accepting mentally ill patients according to law is not an act of illegal deprivation of personal liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;7&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illegal detention did not exceed 24 hours, and there were insulting circumstances, and the insulting behavior constituted a crime. Since the constituent element of the crime of insult has the element of &amp;ldquo;openness&amp;rdquo;, and illegal detention is generally carried out in a secret state, the &amp;ldquo;crime of insult&amp;rdquo; in this case should be the crime of compulsively insulting women against women. Of course, if there are multiple people committing a crime together or multiple victims, it can also be considered as &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo;, then &amp;ldquo;insulting behavior constitutes a crime&amp;rdquo; may also refer to constituting the crime of insulting. In the case of the crime of insult, according to the judicial interpretation, it must also constitute the crime of illegal detention. This kind of situation belongs to the overlapping of laws and regulations. According to the principle of special law priority of overlapping and overlapping laws and regulations, in this case, illegal detention should be established. crime. When the crime of compulsively insulting women is constituted, a concurrent criminal offense shall also be established. If the illegal detention does not have other aggravating or transforming circumstances, the crime of compulsively insulting women is a felony. &amp;ldquo;principle, the crime of compulsively insulting women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illegal detention did not exceed 24 hours, and there were insulting circumstances, and the insulting behavior did not constitute a crime. Whether this situation constitutes a crime needs to be judged in light of the specific circumstances of the case.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The behavior of being withdrawn by someone after the ATM has not taken the card</title>

        <pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/the-behavior-someone-after-the-atm-has-not-taken-the-card/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/the-behavior-someone-after-the-atm-has-not-taken-the-card/images/ATM-scaled-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post The behavior of being withdrawn by someone after the ATM has not taken the card" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw this message on the campus QQ group tonight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, on March 5th, a classmate of our school ** forgot to take out the card after withdrawing money at the China Construction Bank ATM at the headquarters of Foshan University. Contact the bank card person (13695249899) to return the money, and promise not to pursue legal responsibility and keep it confidential. Otherwise, if it is not returned within a week, it will be handled by the police. You will be responsible for the legal responsibility. Don’t leave a criminal record to affect your future! Please help Chuan Chuan, thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon for the balance to be taken away due to failure to withdraw the card after the ATM operation, and some people even wait for others to forget the card. ¹Of course, if the above information is true, I believe that based on years of experience in the university, the &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo; who withdraws the money later should have done it on a temporary basis. After all, the school is a relatively closed place. Behaviors such as &amp;ldquo;spotting&amp;rdquo; to withdraw money are obviously not in line with the criminal psychology of this type of crime. Most of them will choose a place with a lot of people. At least a lot of people means a higher chance of forgetting to pull out the card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the behavior of taking money while the owner is negligent seems very simple, even pure, but there are great differences in the characterization of this behavior in the academic circles. There are two main points of view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Anyone who withdraws money from an ATM without asking the source of the card should be considered the crime of theft; 2. The act of picking up another person&amp;rsquo;s credit card and using it on an automatic teller machine (ATM) falls under the circumstance of &amp;ldquo;fraudulently using another person&amp;rsquo;s credit card&amp;rdquo; as stipulated in Item (3) of Paragraph 1 of Article 196 of the Criminal Law, which constitutes a crime. Pursue criminal responsibility for credit card fraud.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first point of view is represented by Professor Zhang Mingkai of Tsinghua University:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;       In such cases, we cannot simply understand the provisions of Article 196 of the Criminal Law, and we should not only look at the fraudulent use of other people&amp;rsquo;s credit cards or the use of counterfeit credit cards, but should combine the elements of &amp;ldquo;conducting credit card fraud activities&amp;rdquo; in this article, that is, It must be that the victim has a misunderstanding and disposes of property based on the misunderstanding, otherwise it cannot be called &amp;ldquo;cheating&amp;rdquo;. Assuming that the criminal law does not stipulate the crime of fraud, fraud is the indirect principal offender of theft. Therefore, the crime of fraud must be to deceive a natural person, and it is impossible for an ATM to be deceived. There is no dispute about this in countries with civil law systems or countries with common law systems. For example, both Germany and Japan stipulate the crime of &amp;ldquo;using computer fraud&amp;rdquo;, which essentially refers to theft of property interests. The perpetrator hacked into the computer terminal of the bank&amp;rsquo;s computer, transferred the victim&amp;rsquo;s bank deposits into his own passbook, and did not withdraw the money. In our country, it must be convicted of theft, but in Germany and Japan, the crime of theft cannot be convicted, because the two In China, the crime of theft is limited to property, and only fraud includes property interests. Why can&amp;rsquo;t the object of the crime of theft be expanded to property interests? Because there is no starting point for their property crimes, if property interests are used as the object of the theft crime, it will cause confusion. For example, staying in someone’s air-conditioned room without authorization for two minutes may constitute the crime of theft. Lecture attendance may also constitute the crime of theft. Moreover, &amp;ldquo;the crime of using computers to defraud&amp;rdquo; is not a crime of fraud, because it is impossible for the cash machine to be deceived, and it is impossible for the cash machine to make a mistake. As long as it complies with the withdrawal procedure and enters the correct password, the cash machine will operate as usual regardless of whether the cash drawer is the cardholder or not. Work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It believes that the reason why credit card fraud is convicted separately is because it has the meaning of &amp;ldquo;fraud&amp;rdquo;. If there is no &amp;ldquo;fraud&amp;rdquo; behavior, it should be positioned as the crime of theft. We can also simply understand Professor Zhang’s point of view: put money in the announcement safe—open the safe—unlock it—the balance is taken away by others—“others” constitute the crime of theft. As for the ATM, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what kind of thing it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;       The key difference between the crime of theft and the crime of fraud is that the crime of theft violates the will of the victim, while the crime of fraud involves the voluntary disposal of property by the victim based on flawed knowledge. As far as this type of case is concerned, since the perpetrator withdraws money from the ATM against the will of the victim, any perpetrator who withdraws money from the ATM without asking the source of the card should be deemed the crime of theft. If you withdraw money on the counter, you need to distinguish between two situations. If you withdraw money on the counter after stealing a credit card, it is the crime of theft; Fraud, because at this time the bank staff had a misunderstanding, thinking that the fraudulent user was the cardholder. There are two points to note here: first, picking up credit cards is an inconsequential act, because picking up without other actions cannot be convicted; second, the damage to property does not lie in picking up, stealing or snatching credit cards, but in how they are used credit card. For example, if the actor picks up the credit card and withdraws 5,000 yuan from the ATM, and then withdraws 5,000 yuan from the counter, it should be determined that the actor has committed the crime of theft and credit card fraud. crime. If the perpetrator withdraws money directly from an ATM while others forget to take out the card, he should be charged with theft, not embezzlement. Because as long as the money is not taken out, it cannot be regarded as a forgotten thing, because it is in the possession of the bank at this time, and embezzlement is the act of taking the property that one owns as his own; even if he picks up other people&amp;rsquo;s credit cards, the perpetrator only possesses the credit card itself , not the amount on the credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the difference is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reply of the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate on how to characterize the behavior of picking up someone else&amp;rsquo;s credit card and using it on an automatic teller machine (ATM)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Adopted at the 92nd Meeting of the Tenth Procuratorial Committee of the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate on February 19, 2008)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhejiang Provincial People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your hospital&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Request for Instructions on How to Qualify the Behavior of Picking up Other People&amp;rsquo;s Credit Cards and Using It on ATMs&amp;rdquo; (Zhejianyan [2007] No. 227) has been received. After research, the approval is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The act of picking up another person&amp;rsquo;s credit card and using it on an automatic teller machine (ATM) falls under the circumstance of &amp;ldquo;fraudulently using another person&amp;rsquo;s credit card&amp;rdquo; as stipulated in Item (3) of Paragraph 1 of Article 196 of the Criminal Law, which constitutes a crime and shall be charged with the credit card. Criminal responsibility for fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announcement of the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate of the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Reply of the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate on How to Qualify the Behavior of Picking Up Others&amp;rsquo; Credit Cards and Using It on Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs)&amp;rdquo; was passed by the 92nd Meeting of the Tenth Procuratorial Committee of the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate on February 19, 2008 , is hereby promulgated and shall come into force on May 7, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Procuratorate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;                                      April 18, 2008&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in reality, almost all cases of this kind are sentenced without exception to &amp;ldquo;crime of credit card fraud&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The crime of credit card fraud (Article 196 of the Criminal Law) refers to the act of defrauding large amounts of property by using credit cards for the purpose of illegal possession, in violation of credit card management regulations. ²&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might as well analyze whether the crime of credit card fraud is constituted from the traditional theory of crime constitution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;object of crime&lt;/strong&gt;: This behavior has violated the public and private property ownership of the relevant parties of the bank and credit card and the country&amp;rsquo;s credit card management system;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of the criminal object (the social relationship protected by the criminal law violated by the suspect), the crime of credit card fraud focuses more on the protection of the credit card management system. (But it is true that it is difficult to understand how it jeopardizes the credit card management system in the case of forgetting to take out the card and being withdrawn by someone.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;objective elements of crime&lt;/strong&gt;: Fraudulently using someone else&amp;rsquo;s credit card to withdraw money, knowing that the credit card is not your own, but still continuing to conduct transactions with the ATM machine, this is a typical fraudulent use, anyway, except for obtaining the consent of the cardholder, it is all fraudulent use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;subjective aspect&lt;/strong&gt;: Intention to illegally occupy other people&amp;rsquo;s property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The crime of theft (Article 264 of the Criminal Law) refers to the act of secretly stealing a relatively large amount of public and private property for the purpose of illegal possession, or secretly stealing public and private property several times.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of the crime of theft, the object of the violation is the ownership of public and private property, which objectively shows the behavior of secretly stealing public and private property (no one voluntarily surrenders property based on being deceived, and ATM, which cannot be used as a tool for being deceived, is not available. &amp;ldquo;Person&amp;rdquo;), and subjectively and intentionally illegally occupy other people&amp;rsquo;s property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this very simple act can be evaluated in two different ways in the field of criminal law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think both conclusions are very convincing, and it is reasonable for academic circles and judicial practice to adopt one method each. The theory of &amp;ldquo;theft&amp;rdquo; adopted by the academic circle is more in line with the objective reality and the development direction of the criminal law, while the &amp;ldquo;credit card fraud&amp;rdquo; adopted in judicial practice is more based on the &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; itself and according to the actual social situation (the starting point of the crime of theft) is too low, and there are many occurrences of such events that are not particularly harmful).&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/discussion-on-the-defects-of-death-respite-system/images/nirbhaya-death-penalty-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post Discussion on the Defects of  Death Respite System" /&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;The system of suspended execution of death penalty is an original penalty execution system created by New China. It has played an important role in restricting the actual execution of death penalty in the history of our country. There are many flaws in the death reprieve system, which lacks scientificity, rationality and fairness. The article lists and expounds seven defects of the death reprieve system, and believes that these defects must be improved for the continued existence of the death reprieve system in our country.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article 48 of my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; stipulates:“For criminals who should be sentenced to death, if it is not necessary to execute immediately, they can be sentenced to death with a two-year suspension of execution.“This article is my country&amp;rsquo;s death penalty suspension system, referred to as death penalty reprieve, and death penalty reprieve is not an independent penalty, but a system for the application of death penalty. At the same time, Article 50 of my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; also stipulates that for criminals who have been sentenced to death with a reprieve, there are three ways to deal with them after the execution period of the reprieve expires:“If a death sentence is suspended, during the period of suspension of execution, if there is no intentional crime,After the expiration of the two-year period, it shall be commuted to life imprisonment; if there are indeed major meritorious service performances, it shall be reduced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than 15 years but not more than 20 years after the expiration of the two-year period; if it is found to be true for an intentional crime, it shall be approved by the Supreme People&amp;rsquo;s Court execution.“The provisions of the &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; on the death reprieve system are limited to this, but the above-mentioned provisions do have many defects. According to the basic principle of legally prescribed crimes, specific issues should be regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;if-a-person-with-a-reprieve-commits-an-intentional-crime-during-the-period-of-probation-does-the-death-penalty-need-to-expire-after-a-two-year-probationary-period&#34;&gt;If a person with a reprieve commits an intentional crime during the period of probation, does the death penalty need to expire after a two-year probationary period?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been controversy over whether a two-year probationary period is required before executions are carried out. Article 48 of my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; stipulates: &amp;ldquo;The death penalty is only applicable to criminals who have committed extremely serious crimes. For criminals who should be sentenced to death, if they do not have to be executed immediately, they can be sentenced to death with a two-year suspension of execution.&amp;rdquo; Therefore Some scholars believe that the purpose of the legislation is to give reprieve offenders a road to rehabilitation, and this requires a comprehensive examination of the performance of reprieve offenders during the two-year probation period. If not wait. If the death penalty is executed without waiting for the expiration of the two-year period, it is suspected of violating the legislative purpose of the death reprieve system. Another point of view is that the two-year reprieve is conditional. If the reprieve still refuses to repent and the intentional crime is verified to be true, the death penalty should be approved, not necessarily after the two-year period expires. There is also a view that the time limit for changing the death sentence from a reprieve to an immediate execution of the death penalty should be treated in a specific case. According to the suspended death sentence, if the crime committed by the offender during the probation period should be executed immediately, there is no need to wait for the expiration of the two-year period; The death penalty shall not be carried out. The author agrees with the third point of view, that criminals with reprieve should be treated differently for their intentional crimes during the probation period: on the one hand, for criminals who should be executed immediately during the probation period, the death penalty can be executed without waiting for two years after approval; On the one hand, for those who have committed other crimes during the probation period, the death penalty will not be executed until the expiration of two years. Although from an objective point of view, among the criminals with reprieve who committed crimes other than the immediate execution of the death penalty, there are many criminals who are subjectively vicious and have no sincerity in reforming themselves. The purpose is to determine a certain time limit and give criminals a chance to reform themselves, and within this statutory period, the criminal enforcement agency will conduct a comprehensive inspection of criminals. This time limit should be established by the legislator based on some reasonable basis, and cannot be shortened or extended at will, otherwise the two-year reprieve system itself is flawed and should not be set in the death reprieve system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-deal-with-the-death-reprieve-inmate-who-commits-an-intentional-crime-after-performing-major-meritorious-service-during-the-suspension-period&#34;&gt;How to deal with the death reprieve inmate who commits an intentional crime after performing major meritorious service during the suspension period
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the provisions of Article 210, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law and Article 50 of the Criminal Law, during the period of suspension of execution, if a prisoner with a reprieve does perform major meritorious service, after the expiration of the two-year period, the number of years shall be reduced to not less than 15 but not more than 20 years. Fixed-term imprisonment; if an intentional crime is found to be true, the death penalty shall be executed. However, there is no provision in the current law on how to deal with a person with a reprieve who first performs major meritorious service and then commits an intentional crime during the reprieve period. Regarding this issue, some scholars believe that a choice in favor of the criminal should be made, that is, the death penalty should not be executed; however, since the criminal commits a crime intentionally while performing major meritorious service, the sentence should be reduced to life imprisonment. Scholars also believe that crimes can be divided intoSerious intentional crimes that should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment, etc., and different treatment for reprieved criminals according to the degree of major meritorious service. The author believes that intentional crime and major meritorious service are two different concepts, which lack comparability and are difficult to judge and compare in practice. Moreover, major meritorious services are the circumstances of sentencing or commutation of sentences, which have no impact on the determination of intentional crimes. It lacks legal basis, scientificity and rationality to offset the legal consequences of intentional crimes. In this case, because it does not comply with the provisions of commutation to fixed-term imprisonment for major meritorious service, it does not meet the provisions of executing the death penalty for intentionally committed crimes, and it does not meet the requirements for commuting to life imprisonment for those without intentional crimes. Provisions. In the absence of a legal basis in the current law, it is up to the legislature to amend the legislation or at least make a legislative interpretation to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-deal-with-the-death-reprieve-criminal-who-commits-an-intentional-crime-and-then-performs-major-meritorious-service-during-the-suspension-period&#34;&gt;How to deal with the death reprieve criminal who commits an intentional crime and then performs major meritorious service during the suspension period
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;my country&amp;rsquo;s penal regulations stipulate that if a prisoner with reprieve commits an intentional crime during the period of reprieve, the death penalty shall be executed in accordance with the penalty and verified to be true. If the death penalty is carried out without waiting for the two-year period to expire if some scholars believe that there is an intentional crime during the period of probation, then it is obviously impossible to reasonably deal with the emergence of such a situation. Some scholars believe that after the expiration of the two-year probation period, the intentional crimes and major meritorious services within two years can be fully liquidated, and the merits and demerits can be balanced to obtain the final verdict of approving the death penalty or commuting to other penalties. However, if the final result is not to approve the death penalty: because major meritorious service performance should become the sentencing circumstances of intentional crimes, and the sentencing circumstances can only be applied once, so as to compensate for the immediate execution of the death penalty, it will be applied twice, which is obviously not allowed , is also unfair and unreasonable. The author believes that for criminals who committed both intentional crimes and major meritorious service during the suspension of execution of the death sentence, we can comprehensively examine the benefits brought by their meritorious service to the country and society, as well as the degree of personal danger reduction reflected by repentance, and analyze The proportion between &amp;ldquo;sin&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;atonement&amp;rdquo; among them will be analyzed in detail. but currently noWhen amending legislation or making corresponding legislative interpretations, this approach cannot rule out the opportunity for very few criminals to commit intentional crimes: they hold clues to major meritorious service, deliberately refuse to report it, but use it to commit intentional crimes, Afterwards, it was reported to confirm the performance of major crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-deal-with-the-general-meritorious-deeds-of-prisoners-on-death-reprieve-during-the-period-of-suspension&#34;&gt;How to deal with the general meritorious deeds of prisoners on death reprieve during the period of suspension
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since our country&amp;rsquo;s criminal law only stipulates the major meritorious service performed by the death penalty during the suspension period, in judicial practice, this situation has been incorporated into &amp;ldquo;During the suspension period, if there is no intentional crime, after the two-year period expires commuted to life imprisonment&amp;rdquo;. Does it seem unfair that those who have performed meritorious service are treated the same as those who have not committed crimes intentionally? Does the reformation of criminals during the period of reprieve seem less active? However, for general meritorious service, the clauses with major meritorious service cannot be directly applied, so it seems that it is very necessary to deal with the situation of general meritorious service during the suspension of execution. Some scholars suggest that during the period of suspension of execution of the death sentence, if there is indeed meritorious service, it is verified that the sentence is commuted to life imprisonment without waiting for two years. The author believes that any criminal with a suspended death sentence who has performed meritorious service, even if it is not a major meritorious service, is enough to show that the criminal has repented to a large extent and has rehabilitated himself. Such behavior should be used as a legal evaluation during the test period and have an impact on the final result. . Of course, this can only be achieved if the legislature of our country should make overall legislative amendments or at least legislative interpretations on the &amp;ldquo;no intentional crime and no meritorious service&amp;rdquo;, meritorious service and major meritorious service performance of death reprieve criminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-deal-with-the-death-reprieve-criminal-who-intentionally-commits-a-crime-during-the-suspension-period-but-the-circumstances-are-minor&#34;&gt;How to deal with the death reprieve criminal who intentionally commits a crime during the suspension period but the circumstances are minor
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article 50 of my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; stipulates that if a prisoner with reprieve commits an intentional crime during the period of reprieve, and it is verified that it is true, the death penalty shall be executed. This shows that the condition for approving the execution of the death penalty with a reprieve is that the criminal commits an intentional crime during the two-year reprieve. The criminal law does not limit the scope of intentional crimes, which means that as long as criminals commit intentional crimes within a period of two years, no matter what kind of intentional crimes they commit, whether they are direct intentional or indirect intentional, and whether the intentional crimes they commit are The state of completion, or the preparation, attempt, or suspension of the incomplete state does not affect the approval of execution of the death penalty. In this regard, some scholars believe that it is unfair to regard intentional crime as a condition for the execution of the death penalty. It believes that since the crimes committed by the criminals before the reprieve sentence have reached the level of the death penalty, they have not been executed, but the intentional crimes committed during the reprieve period have not reached the level of the death penalty but will be executed. The death penalty is clearly unfair. Some scholars also believe that in my country&amp;rsquo;s criminal law, since the scope of intentional crimes is very wide, and in judicial practice, the criminal circumstances of various intentional crimes are also very different, and the corresponding criminal responsibilities are also divided into degrees of severity. All intentional crimes committed during the execution period will be executed, which may violate the original intention of the Criminal Law and the Criminal Procedure Law to amend the conditions for execution of the death penalty during the suspended execution period. The author believes that, since Article 5 of my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; stipulates: &amp;ldquo;The severity of the penalty shall be commensurate with the crimes committed by the criminals and the criminal responsibilities they bear.&amp;rdquo; Criminal responsibility, and if the crime committed is serious, it should bear heavy criminal responsibility. This is also one of the three basic principles stipulated in my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo;, the &amp;ldquo;principle of commensurate crime and punishment&amp;rdquo;. However, during the reprieve period, if criminals commit subjectively intentional crimes, regardless of the seriousness of the crime, they will all be executed, which obviously violates the principle of adapting crime to punishment, and makes an exception to the principle of adapting crime to punishment in the criminal law. , which is obviously not allowed, nor should it be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the author believes that during the period of reprieve, if the intentional crime is minor and does not need to be sentenced to a penalty or can be exempted from the penalty according to the provisions of the Criminal Law, it should be attributed to the death sentence when the sentence of reprieve is determined.“does not have to be done immediately“situation. If the execution of the death penalty is still carried out on the criminals with reprieve under such circumstances, it will not only violate the original intention of establishing the death penalty system in our country&amp;rsquo;s criminal law, but also fail to realize the function of the death penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-deal-with-criminals-found-to-have-missed-crimes-during-the-period-of-suspension-of-execution-and-after-the-implementation-of-the-change&#34;&gt;How to deal with criminals found to have missed crimes during the period of suspension of execution and after the implementation of the change
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; does not stipulate how to deal with a reprieved prisoner who is found to have other crimes that have not been sentenced during the reprieve test. At this time, should the reprieve be revoked and the reprieve executed for several crimes be punished together, or should the sentence be changed to the death sentence and executed immediately? Some scholars believe that for the missed crimes discovered during the suspension of execution of the death sentence, the provisions of Article 70 of the &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; can be referred to to make a judgment on the newly discovered crime, and then the punishment for the subsequent crime and the execution of the suspended death sentence should be combined. Decide on the penalty to be imposed. The author believes that for the omissions found during the probation period, they should be executed together. In this case, there are two results of concurrent punishment, the decision to execute the death penalty with a reprieve and the decision to execute the death penalty immediately. It depends on the degree of the crime of omission: if the crime of omission should be sentenced to death penalty with immediate execution, then it should be sentenced to execution with suspension of death penalty and the final decision should be immediate execution of death penalty; Concurrent punishment for execution should generally continue to be executed with a suspended sentence of execution; even if the omission of a crime should be sentenced to death with a suspended execution, the combined execution can only be executed with a suspended death sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current laws and judicial interpretations of our country do not involve how to deal with the case where a death reprieve commits an intentional crime during the period of reprieve, but is discovered after the two-year period has expired and the sentence has been commuted, and the statute of limitations for prosecution has not expired. However, in judicial practice, some intentional crimes committed by inmates with reprieve during the period of probation, such as theft in prisons, are generally concealed, and are often not discovered during the two-year probation period of the probation. It was discovered after being commuted to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment, and the intentional crime committed again has not exceeded the limitation period for prosecution. Regarding the handling of this situation, some scholars believe: &amp;ldquo;Although the &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Criminal Procedure Law&amp;rdquo; only stipulate that a person with a reprieve who commits an intentional crime during the period of suspension of execution shall be executed, there is no regulation on when the intentional crime is discovered. However, The death penalty has been commuted and the sentence determined after the commutation is being executed. Therefore, based on the principle of benefiting the defendant, the death penalty should not be executed on the criminal at this time, and a judgment should be made for the newly discovered crime. Implementing combined punishment for several crimes determines the penalty to be executed by the criminal.” The author agrees with this point of view, and at the same time, this issue should also be discussed in two situations. It is necessary to distinguish the time when the omission of crime is discovered after the probation period expires, and the commutation ruling has not yet been made. What was discovered before was that after the probationary period expired, the omission of crime was discovered only after the commutation ruling was made. If the new crime is discovered after the probation period has expired and before the commutation ruling is made, after the new crime is verified to be true, the execution of the death penalty shall be changed for the reprieved criminal. The reason is that at this time the commutation ruling has not yet been made, and the reprieve has not yet been finally changed. After the new crime is verified to be true, the death penalty should be changed for the reprieved criminal. And if the new crime is discovered after the commutation ruling is made, the death penalty should not be changed to the reprieved prisoner. The reason is that the commutation ruling has been made at this time, and the reprieve has been changed to life imprisonment or fixed-term imprisonment. Based on the stability of the law and the principle of benefiting criminals, the execution of the death sentence should not be changed to the reprieve, but should be executed with the new crime after the judgment is made. The sentence being executed shall be punished in combination in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Law, and the sentence to be executed shall be determined as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;during-the-period-of-reprieve-the-reprieve-commits-crimes-that-are-dealt-with-only-after-being-informed-and-how-to-deal-with-those-who-have-not-been-informed&#34;&gt;During the period of reprieve, the reprieve commits crimes that are dealt with only after being informed, and how to deal with those who have not been informed
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article 50 of my country&amp;rsquo;s Criminal Law stipulates that if a person with a reprieve commits an intentional crime and it is verified that it is true, the death penalty shall be executed. However, the criminal law does not clarify whether the &amp;ldquo;intentional crime&amp;rdquo; includes crimes that are dealt with only after notification. In view of the fact that the death penalty commits a crime that is dealt with only after being informed during the execution of the suspended sentence, but the victim did not tell, and there is no situation where &amp;ldquo;the victim cannot tell due to coercion and intimidation&amp;rdquo;, some scholars believe that if the death penalty is executed, then the judiciary will take the initiative. Ascertaining the facts of this crime is &amp;ldquo;contrary to the establishment purpose of the crime that is dealt with only after being informed.&amp;rdquo; The author believes that it is reasonable to exclude the crime that is dealt with only after being informed, because in this case, if the victim does not tell, the judiciary will not be able to Will not take the initiative to prosecute, the perpetrator will not be held criminally responsible. Moreover, crimes dealt with only after being informed are excluded, which is in line with the purpose of the death reprieve system: the modern death reprieve system &amp;ldquo;is the embodiment of the penalty concept of &amp;lsquo;use the death penalty with caution&amp;rsquo; and is established under the guidance of the modern penalty purpose of &amp;lsquo;combining punishment and education&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; up system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system of reprieve is a very effective way of execution of death penalty created by my country&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Criminal Law&amp;rdquo;, which can not only retain the deterrent effect of death penalty, but also effectively reduce the actual application of death penalty. Currently restricting and abolishing the death penalty has become an irreversible trend in the world. Since our country does not yet have the historical and realistic conditions for abolishing the death penalty and immediately executing it, we should give full play to the effectiveness of the death penalty system and use it as a reasonable choice for restricting the death penalty at this stage. However, in view of the various defects and imperfections of the death reprieve system, the author believes that the reform of the death reprieve system is imperative, or at leastIt is up to the legislature to amend the legislation or at least make legislative interpretations to address the many deficiencies in the death reprieve system,Only in this way can this penal system with Chinese characteristics be implemented more stably.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After roughly reading &amp;ldquo;The Spirit of Laws&amp;rdquo;, it is of course impossible to read the original work. This is a &amp;ldquo;miniature color print&amp;rdquo;, which is actually a &amp;ldquo;obscene color print&amp;rdquo;. (not with pictures)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The editor may have put a lot of color pictures on each page because of his good intentions, but in my eyes, these pictures did not play a big role, on the contrary they kept disturbing my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending half the night flipping through this masterpiece, I found that I was so sorry for Montesquieu. However, if many things are placed in the freshman and sophomore year, I will definitely go deeper, but now,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that I don’t have a lot of time, so I can only briefly mention many theoretical things, and try to pick out some valuable viewpoints and extract them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has already been scratched several times with a pencil by the predecessors, but I still persisted and continued to scratch some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mainly read the two volumes &amp;ldquo;Law and Regime&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Relationship between Law and Climate and National Spirit&amp;rdquo;. Most of the other volumes were directly turned page by page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t go into details about Montesquieu and the greatness of this book. Brother Xu said that if he talked about Rousseau, he couldn&amp;rsquo;t finish it in a week. I think it would take longer if he was allowed to talk about Montesquieu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very few perfect people through the ages, but Montesquieu is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the views on China are quite incisive, and even predicted the current problems in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t like to read books, so we didn’t pay much attention to the translation of &amp;ldquo;The Principle of Ten Thousand Laws&amp;rdquo; translated over 107 years ago and &amp;ldquo;Fa Yi&amp;rdquo; translated 96 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it is a miracle in itself that such an insightful book could have been written in 1748.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
