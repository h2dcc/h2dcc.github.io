        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/difficult-to-enable-the-ipv6-feature-for-home-broadband/images/network-cable-ethernet-computer-159304.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post Difficult to enable the IPV6 feature for home broadband" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year, China Mobile upgraded the management interface of its optical modem routers to dynamic passwords, making it impossible for users to modify the networking mode using the super passwords circulating on the internet. Yesterday, I called the 10086 customer service hotline, hoping to have China Mobile activate IPV6 for me through their backend. However, the operator said they didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the issue and were not aware of what IPV6 is. The operator replied that they would have a company technician contact me. This morning, a technician from China Mobile called me, saying that enabling IPV6 was part of their business services and advised me to go to a local China Mobile business hall to get it done, or request a technician to come over for maintenance.&lt;br&gt;
I thought it was a simple matter of having a technician come over and use the dynamic super password they possess to log into the optical modem router&amp;rsquo;s backend and switch from IPV4 to IPV6. So, I called China Mobile&amp;rsquo;s 10086 customer service hotline to report a fault and request a technician to come over for repair. However, the outcome was unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The after-sales technician took one look at my home optical modem router and said that the device was too outdated to support IPV6 gigabit networks. They offered to upgrade it to a 10-gigabit optical modem router for free. I thought, &amp;ldquo;Why not, it&amp;rsquo;s free&amp;rdquo; and agreed to the replacement.&lt;br&gt;
The problem was that the new optical modem router could not register on China Mobile&amp;rsquo;s network. This led to the following events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technician who came over first sought advice from the most technically proficient members of their local team on how to solve the problem. They sent him an offline repair software, but it still didn&amp;rsquo;t work after multiple tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technician then contacted China Mobile&amp;rsquo;s backend support technicians, who advised him to test with another optical modem router to see if it could register. Other devices worked fine, pinpointing the problem to the new 10-gigabit optical modem router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technician contacted the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s technical staff of the optical modem router. They sent him a system upgrade package and extracted the router&amp;rsquo;s system logs. However, after joint analysis by several technicians from the manufacturer, they still couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the cause of the problem. They even tested another identical 10-gigabit optical modem router, which also failed to connect.&lt;br&gt;
After hours of attempts, the problem still couldn&amp;rsquo;t be resolved. In the end, we had to put it aside temporarily, and the manufacturer said they would send technicians to my home for debugging in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the current outcome is not satisfactory, I am still grateful to these technicians. Especially seeing them still working during their lunch break and the fact that the technicians from China Mobile and the optical modem router manufacturer are available 24/7 to assist with any questions, it&amp;rsquo;s really not an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Updating to VIVO Smartphone and Watch</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/updating-to-vivo-smartphone-and-watch/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/updating-to-vivo-smartphone-and-watch/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/updating-to-vivo-smartphone-and-watch/images/img_20240401_0932495013864575354211093.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Updating to VIVO Smartphone and Watch" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I purchased the Vivo X100 Pro smartphone and also got the Vivo Watch 3 smartwatch. Additionally, because I found my previous mobile plan with China Mobile to be too expensive, I added a mobile SIM card plan from China Broadcasting Network. Here, I&amp;rsquo;ll briefly share my experiences with these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vivo-x100-pro&#34;&gt;VIVO X100 PRO
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vivo X100 Pro claims to be one of the most powerful camera phones among domestic Chinese smartphones. From my recent usage, I feel it lives up to this reputation, and I decisively chose the 1TB storage version when purchasing. The Dimensity 9300 CPU it&amp;rsquo;s equipped with is a significant upgrade from the Dimensity 9000 in the Vivo X80 I used previously, and the memory has also increased from 12GB to 16GB, which means I probably won&amp;rsquo;t need to consider changing phones for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before using the Vivo X80, I had never purchased any Vivo products, nor had I bought anything from its sister brand, OPPO. However, in the past few years, Vivo and OPPO have frequently been among the top five in China&amp;rsquo;s smartphone sales rankings, and sometimes even in the top five globally. During the period when Huawei was unreasonably sanctioned by the U.S. government and couldn&amp;rsquo;t produce 5G phones, I was due for a phone upgrade and bought the Vivo X80, my first 5G phone. I was immediately impressed. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s the phone&amp;rsquo;s system features, smooth operation, or camera performance, this phone has brought me great surprises. In my history of using BlackBerry, iPhone, Samsung, and Huawei phones, I believe this product ranks in the top three in my mind, along with the BlackBerry 9780 and iPhone 4s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vivo-watch-3&#34;&gt;VIVO Watch 3
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vivo Watch 3 is the third smartwatch I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased, and if counting other smart bands, it&amp;rsquo;s the fifth wearable smart device I&amp;rsquo;ve owned. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously owned the Apple Watch 3, Huawei Watch Fit 2, Honor Band 4, and Xiaomi Band 7. The Vivo watch is not particularly outstanding among smartwatches and lacks the competitive edge of the brand&amp;rsquo;s smartphones. However, it&amp;rsquo;s more affordable, and most importantly, since I&amp;rsquo;m already using a Vivo phone, using a Huawei or other brand&amp;rsquo;s watch would pose significant compatibility issues. I would have to install a Huawei watch app on my Vivo phone, and this app needs to be set to always run in the background and set to &amp;ldquo;high power consumption&amp;rdquo; mode to ensure it&amp;rsquo;s not automatically cleared by the phone system. In fact, for a long time before buying the Vivo Watch 3, the Huawei smartwatch I wore was never connected to my Vivo phone; the watch&amp;rsquo;s Bluetooth function was always turned off because I never knew when it would suddenly disconnect from the Vivo phone, and some phone notification features couldn&amp;rsquo;t be guaranteed to respond on the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main drawback of the Vivo watch is that it runs on Vivo&amp;rsquo;s self-developed BLUEOS system, which is too simple and only supports a few apps. Fortunately, it can still use WeChat, China&amp;rsquo;s most important social app. However, because there are so few apps, the watch has an exceptionally long battery life. In my daily use, I found that the watch can last for 15 days without charging, almost as long as many long-lasting smart bands, which is much better than the daily charging experience of the Apple Watch 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VIVO Watch 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;china-broadnet-mobile-plan&#34;&gt;China Broadnet Mobile Plan
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;China Broadnet is the fourth national mobile operator in China, following China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom. Possibly because it&#39;s a new entrant to the mobile market, China Broadnet offers very attractive mobile plan options. Currently, I chose the 29 yuan per month plan (only 19 yuan per month for the first year), which includes over 150GB of high-speed 5G data and 100 minutes of monthly call time. Compared to my previous China Mobile plan, which was 199 yuan per month for 70GB of data and 500 minutes of calls, plus a free 1000Mbps home fiber broadband, this new plan is a real bargain. After purchasing the China Broadnet SIM card, I downgraded my China Mobile plan to 79 yuan per month, which only includes 10GB of data and 100 minutes of calls, but fortunately, the 1000Mbps home broadband was retained.  
China Broadnet uses mobile communication frequencies in cooperation with operators like China Mobile and China Unicom. So far, whether in urban or remote areas, the overall network signal has been satisfactory. After several months of use, I haven&#39;t encountered any network congestion or loss of phone signal, even in highway tunnels.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-design-a-network-storage-solution-for-family-photos/images/N1-scaled-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post How to design a network storage solution for a large number of family photos" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, as the number of personal electronic documents and photos has grown, I personally currently have roughly 40GB of Office files containing nearly 100,000 DOC documents and countless excel files. My family has over 120,000 files of photos and videos stored, containing jpg cr2 heiv heif mp4 avi and various other formats, which is about 700GB after removing duplicate files.Recently, I re-adjusted some of the cloud storage products and services. Here is how I design a solution for network storage aticles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;clear-about-the-type-of-device-you-have&#34;&gt;Clear about the type of device you have
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;be clear about the type of device you have&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, the main electronic products and network services I am using personally and at home are as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have three main cell phones currently in use at home, namely Huawei P40 Pro ,Vivo X80, Huawei mate 20. I need to meet the demand for each phone to be able to view all the photos of my family anytime and anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently have three computers at home, namely Lenovo Y9000p, Thinkpad P53, Intel NUC12, all equipped with 4K resolution monitors, corresponding to the needs of games, work and network video respectively. In addition there are iPad Pro and vivo pad and other tablet computers, often need to pass files to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have other digital cameras at home, which probably produce about 200GB of photos and videos per year and need secure storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two TVs at home, TCL 75-inch and Sony 65-inch, both with 4K resolution, which need to meet the demand for large bandwidth video viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Synology small NAS at home that can store 4TB of data, but it uses a 2.5-inch hard drive version with lower performance because it needs to be stuffed into a weak box. In addition, I have two Netgear routers at home with a third-party modified version of the Merlin system, which can readily mount large-capacity removable hard drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family uses China Mobile&amp;rsquo;s family mobile data package service, which includes more than 100GB of network traffic per month, which can meet the daily needs of using cell phones to link to cloud storage for uploading and downloading files at any time. In addition, China Mobile also gives 1000Mbps home fiber broadband, which has a download speed of 100MB/s and an upload speed of 5MB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-design-a-network-storage-solution-for-family-photos/images/nas-jpg.webp&#34;
	width=&#34;742&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;567px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive analysis reveals that the biggest problem at present is that my family uses various brands and platforms of smart devices. The cell phone is mainly android platform and Huawei Harmony OS based on android platform, the computer has both windows system and Android and IOS system, and the TV is all Android system. In this case, it is difficult for me to solve my needs through a single cloud storage method. One possible idea is to replace all the major devices I am using with the same brand and the same platform. For example, replacing the Vivo phone I&amp;rsquo;m currently using with a Huawei phone. However, the main reason why I am buying a Vivo phone in 2022 is that Huawei was unjustifiably sanctioned by the U.S., which prevented the 5G chip it designed from being produced, and all the phones on sale are 4G versions. I had to buy a non-Huawei branded 5G phone because the 4G network speed was hard to satisfy me. But this problem will probably be solved in the next few years with the rapid progress of photolithography and chip manufacturing technology in mainland China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;break-down-your-needs-into-the-specialized-terms&#34;&gt;Break down your needs into the specialized terms
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;break down your needs into the specialized terms&lt;/strong&gt; that correspond to cloud storage services. For example, my personal and family needs can be summarized as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;high-capacity storage space: photo storage services of 1TB or more;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;multi-platform sharing: compatible with Android/Windows/IOS and other platforms;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;intranet high-speed transfer: support CloudSync of Synology NAS; (WebDav and other unofficial and unstable ways are not considered)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;extranet high-speed transfer: support 20MB/S download service and 5MB/s upload service;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;security and privacy: integrity of data preservation and reliable privacy protection;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;document management: professional Office document management;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;album management: professional photo management;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;intelligent photo albums: automatic photo organization by means of artificial intelligence;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;efficient search: providing text \OCR\ intelligent recognition search;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;suitable cost: affordable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;look-for-a-network-storage-service-that-corresponds-to-your-needs&#34;&gt;look for a network storage service that corresponds to your needs
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, &lt;strong&gt;look for a network storage service that corresponds to your needs&lt;/strong&gt;. Here, I briefly list some of the storage services I have used in the last 10 years:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Synology NAS Ds416slim 4*2TB (available capacity 4TB), mainly used to store family photos and videos. one-time purchase cost in 2017 was RMB 4,000, no plans to update in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;115.com cloud storage.115.com cloud storage 80TB, mainly used to store illegal resources on the Internet. 2014 one-time purchase cost is RMB 400 (2014-2024), no renewal plan after expiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onedrive Home Edition 6TB , mainly used to store online books and photos and videos, etc. Microsoft 365 Home Edition, annual cost of 220 RMB, ongoing subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei Cloud 2TB, used only to backup Huawei cell phone photos and videos. Costs 750 RMB per year, renewal cancelled in March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aliyun Cloud 2TB, used only for downloading movies, TV shows and other web resources. Free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu Cloud 2TB , used only for downloading web resources. Free of charge, with occasional paid usage at 30 RMB per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChinaMobile Cloud 9TB, only used to backup home files. Limited free (because I am a China Mobile mobile data package user, free gift).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WPS Cloud 1TB for WPS Office document storage only. 2019 one-time purchase cost is RMB 600 (2019-2029), current renewal fee is RMB 250 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iCloud, a 200GB version was previously purchased during the family&amp;rsquo;s use of iPhones and has not been used since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long time of using the above products and services, here I briefly talk about the experience of using them. At the same time, I also made a table to list my scoring of these products and services, and as my personal decision basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-synology-nas&#34;&gt;1. Synology NAS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAS is my largest one-time investment in storage, and the value of its use is undeniable. There are mainly the following conveniences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The storage capacity is large enough to store all the important family files conveniently, and it has strong privacy, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about leaking personal privacy. In terms of data security, I set up two sets of Raid 1 for the four hard drives and manually back up important data to the removable drive from time to time so that I can recover the data even if the drive is destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. You can easily backup to a network drive. For example, NAS files can be synchronized and backed up to cloud storage such as Baidu Cloud and Onedrive via the built-in CloudSync program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. High-speed file transfer within the home is possible. NAS folders can be mounted to any computer and smartphone, tablet, or TV at home via protocols such as Samba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are very big limitations in using Synology NAS in home use, especially in China&amp;rsquo;s network environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Currently, most of the home broadband users in China are using shared IPv4 pools, and there is no fixed IPv4, so there is no way to open NAS files quickly on networks outside the home. You need to use a third party network penetration service, which increases the cost of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Although Synology provides Quick connect, an external network access service, the reliability of this service is not high in China, and the speed of file transfer is less than 500KB/s, which is less practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. China&amp;rsquo;s home broadband is an asymmetric network, the 1Gbps fiber optic network I am currently using at home, although the downlink speed can reach more than 100MB/s, but the maximum upload speed of files is only 5MB/s, which is difficult to achieve high-speed file outgoing transmission. operators usually limit the upload speed of home users&amp;rsquo; network to about 30-40Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. In China&amp;rsquo;s network environment, currently large files (e.g., 4K videos, TV episodes, etc.) are usually downloaded using network hard disk mode. In actual use, network drives such as Aliyun Cloud , ChinaMobile Cloud, etc. provide TV/PC clients directly to provide 4K video online viewing services. Unless the individual has a strong collection fetish, it is already very unwise to download video and TV episode files to local viewing. This also further compresses the limitations of NAS usage, making it more focused on internal home file usage rather than an aid for using network files.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;108px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-115-cloud&#34;&gt;2. 115 Cloud
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to personal observation, most of the users who use 115 cloud storage are storing illegal video files. For example: pirated pornographic videos, pirated movies, etc. The following advantages are available when storing these files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Large capacity. 115 Cloud provided unlimited storage space for some paid users before 2014, which could be obtained using lower cost at that time. I did not purchase the unlimited space service back then, but I purchased a 10-year regular membership for RMB 40 per year to get access to 80TB of space. The current membership renewal offer is around 200 RMB per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Fast speed. 115 Cloud download speed is about 200Mbps, which is enough for daily use, because even 4K video online only needs 100Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Easy to upload files. 115 Cloud can easily store files using magnet links, bt seed files, SHA1 collisions, etc. There are plenty of such resources available in some websites. For example, just by providing a magnet link of the top 500 movies in imdb list, you can store HD video files of 500 movies to the user&amp;rsquo;s 115 Cloud folder in seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. The most strange thing is that in the strictly regulated environment, it is almost impossible for the cloud storage services of Internet giants such as Baidu Alibaba to provide any chance of illegal file storage, but 115 Cloud always runs stably. Needless to say, this is strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 115 Cloud storage wanders on the edge of illegality, its biggest flaw is always the security issue, and it may simply announce its closure during some future crackdown organized by the government on the distribution of illegal files. I believe no user would dare to store important data on such a network drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-onedrive&#34;&gt;3. Onedrive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onedrive has two kinds of storage in China, one is stored in mainland China, operated by Vnet, mainly for business users; the other is stored in Hong Kong or Singapore, operated by Microsoft itself, mainly for personal services. The main advantages are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Better privacy. Compared with other cloud storage in China, Onedrive does a good job in privacy protection. Other cloud stores use SHA1 collision by default when uploading files, so if the file is available in the cloud server, it will bypass the upload step and copy the file directly to the user&amp;rsquo;s folder. ps: Nowadays, this has become a major disadvantage of Onedrive, because users need to upload all files through their own network. For example, uploading a movie file downloaded on the Internet will most likely take only a few seconds on other web sites (most of the Internet resources are backed up in these cloud stores), but Onedrive requires the complete re-upload of the file over the user&amp;rsquo;s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Easy to connect with Windows systems and Offce software. For example, in windows 11, onedrive is the only backup method in the system settings by default. If you need to backup to local hard disk, you need to find the traditional &amp;ldquo;control panel&amp;rdquo; and choose windows 7 backup mode to backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onedrive gives you the option to add all your photos from your personal folder to an album, even if they are not placed in the default photo folder, so you can manage them easily. In addition, onedrive also provides intelligent classification recognition of pictures and text ocr search of pictures.Overall, Onedrive is a moderate cloud storage service. However, since it does not provide localized personal services in mainland China, there are many inconveniences in the process of using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The speed of internet connection is not high. I subscribed to MicroSoft 365 family service, and I can open up to 6 accounts with 6TB storage space, but in the process of using it, I often encounter network blockage, the speed is fast and slow, and occasionally disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. onedrive does not support Chinese well. There have been problems with onedrive in Chinese search. For example, document search does not support Chinese. In the latest version of the app, onedrive still doesn&amp;rsquo;t support Chinese well in photo search, and only the first 50 search results are displayed each time, which is obviously not enough for me who has more than 100,000 photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Some services of Onedrive are blocked in China. For example, there is usually no way to open the photo sharing links directly, you have to borrow VPN and other ways to access them. The web version of onedrive is also blocked in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-huawei-cloud-drive&#34;&gt;4. Huawei Cloud Drive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei&amp;rsquo;s cloud storage solution is similar to iCloud in that it offers 5GB of space for free and 50GB/200GB/2024GB for a fee. The main advantages are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Deeply bound to the cell phone system. You can experience the convenience of cloud services in the album without perception, and because Chinese cell phone manufacturers continue to innovate in the album, the addition of various artificial intelligence recognition services makes it extremely convenient to find photos in the phone. Even if the number of photos I had stored in Huawei&amp;rsquo;s cloud reached hundred of thousands, I was able to quickly filter them out through the search function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. The overall speed of use is smooth. On the one hand, I rarely encounter the situation that I can&amp;rsquo;t open photos because of network problems, and the upload and download speeds are kept at excellent levels. On the other hand, in terms of photo album integration, the photos stored in the cloud are basically the same as local photos, so users don&amp;rsquo;t need to care whether the photos are stored locally or in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Comes with cell phone system backup function. If you turn on a high-capacity cloud package service, you can generally backup your phone files to the cloud as a whole, and you only need to log in to your original account when you change your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as the cloud storage of cell phone manufacturers mainly focus on cell phone use, the scope of use is narrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Cross-platform use is difficult. Unless the whole family uses the same brand of cell phones and computers, it is difficult to share the cloud storage space and its convenience with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. The price is high. For example, Huawei&amp;rsquo;s 2048gb package plan costs RMB 68 per month, more than three times the price of other mainstream consumer cloud storage space on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Huawei cloud storage is in the same class as Apple&amp;rsquo;s iCloud. But because Huawei was sanctioned by the United States, his hardware line is currently less complete and better than Apple&amp;rsquo;s, which is indeed a great pity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-aliyundrive&#34;&gt;5. AliyunDrive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AliyunDrive is a new service launched by Alibaba Group in the last two years, with free and unlimited speed as its main selling point, which relies on Aliyun platform, currently the largest cloud service platform in China. This website is also hosted on AliCloud Singapore server. Because the back of the tree is good to ride, so Ali cloud disk currently also has a great advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. First is its main selling point of unlimited speed as well as free. Currently Ali cloud for free users to provide more than 2TB of cloud disk capacity, and able to through the daily sign-up function and participate in other free activities, regularly receive premium membership services. However, AliCloud&amp;rsquo;s promise of unlimited speed is mainly a huge improvement compared to other consumer network drive services in China, but not completely unlimited speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. AliCloud Drive&amp;rsquo;s user interface is relatively simple and convenient, similar to One drive, and is very user-friendly compared to other consumer network drives in China, without too many ads and other cluttered content displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. The photo management function of AliCloud Drive is relatively powerful, and it can use AI intelligence to identify and sort most photos. In addition, in addition to personal file storage, Ali Cloud Drive also has a very large number of network resources to share, so you can easily access to a variety of file resources on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because Ali Cloud Drive is generally a latecomer to the role, there are some problems in daily use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. The stability of AliCloud Disk App is not high enough, there are some lagging and bug problems. For example, when I used my computer to upload 200GB photos to Ali Cloud Drive, the software freezes occurred many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. AliCloud&amp;rsquo;s photo album function has a completely different storage logic than other web drives. By default, AliCloud will put all the photos and videos uploaded by users into its photo module, and users cannot manage their own photo folders. And after users create new albums under its photo module by themselves, they can only operate 500 photos at a time, and even for photo deletion operation, they can only delete 2000 photos at a time, which is obviously not enough for a large number of photo management needs in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Ali cloud disk privacy protection and Baidu cloud disk as a difficult to say, especially Ali cloud disk itself is focused on free services, is bound to sacrifice a certain amount of user data privacy to meet aliyun computing services for certain purposes. For example, aliyun disk will intelligently identify each photo and video uploaded by users, review its legality, and even immediately displayed a warning is issued within seconds of the user uploading the video that one of the images in the video file has a violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. At present, Ali Cloud Drive has already passed the initial promotion period, and as the user base continues to expand, the online fee model and other usage restrictions may increasingly become the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-baidu-cloud-drive&#34;&gt;6. Baidu Cloud Drive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu Cloud Drive was a network storage that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to mention here at all because there were too many bad experiences. But overall, Baidu Cloud Drive is still the most used network drive service in China. The main advantages are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Baidu Cloud Drive was developed earlier and has a huge user base base and a first mover advantage. It is the most complete network resource on the entire Chinese Internet. But this is actually not too attractive for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Baidu Cloud Drive provides 2TB of storage space for free users, which is enough for the vast majority of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Baidu Cloud Drive, combined with Baidu Search and Baidu Library, is the preferred file sharing method for most Chinese web users. If one is going to share a large number of files with others, using Baidu Cloud Drive, the other party is generally acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Baidu Cloud Drive has a spotty history of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Baidu Cloud Drive is probably one of the most restrictive network drives in the world for free users. Free registered users of Baidu Cloud Drive can usually only reach 20KB/s when downloading files, which is not at all like something a modern network service company can do. It has now improved under the verbal criticism of the general media, but it is still not friendly enough for free users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Baidu Cloud Drive monitors and deletes user files. As long as a file is intelligently identified by Baidu Cloud Drive as illegal or potentially risky, Baidu Cloud Drive will delete the file without informing the user. Since this intelligent identification is done automatically by the machine and does not give any hint to the user, it is easy to give the user the risk of losing the file. In case the file is deleted by mistake, there is basically no possibility for the user to get the file back.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above mentioned is the case of the free version of Baidu Cloud Drive, if you buy Baidu Cloud Drive paid services, the experience will feel much better, except for automatic deletion of user files and privacy issues, the other is first-class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-chinamobile-cloud-drive&#34;&gt;7. ChinaMobile Cloud Drive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, the three major mobile operators in China, all offer their own network cloud storage services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the quality of cloud storage services operated by these three companies are similar. The main advantage is that mobile operators&amp;rsquo; network cloud drives usually exempt users from charging for cell phone traffic when using the cloud drive, and users are able to store and download services smoothly when using the operators&amp;rsquo; mobile communication networks and home fiber broadband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all three carriers&amp;rsquo; network drives have the same problem; all three of their offerings are technically inferior to other network drive services. For example, China Mobile Cloud Drive&amp;rsquo;s folders can only copy and move up to a few thousand files at a time, which is extremely inconvenient for users like me who have a huge number of files. In addition, China Mobile Cloud Drive&amp;rsquo;s intelligent photo recognition function can only identify up to 20 kinds of categories, which is a huge gap compared to cell phone manufacturers and other consumer network cloud drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if it is used as a file backup tool, I personally think it is still very suitable, because China&amp;rsquo;s mobile operators are state-owned enterprises, they can hardly take users&amp;rsquo; private data to meet other commercial purposes like other private companies, and these giant state-owned enterprises are at a very high level in the Chinese government agencies, so it is difficult for ordinary regulators to access these files, and the privacy for users is still better than other Internet companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-wps-cloud-drive&#34;&gt;8. WPS Cloud Drive
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WPS Cloud Drive is similar to onedrive, but its functionality is completely limited to WPS office files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried to use WPS Cloud Drive to store some of my personal photos, but there is no way to manage them other than folders. And its search function is developed based on document logic, there is almost no possibility to search for photos unless you can remember the file name of the photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Chinese network environment, WPS cloud drive is the best way to store office files, he provides a complete text and OCR search function, and WPS office itself for the vast majority of non-professional users, has enough to compete with Microsoft office, the price is also much cheaper than Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it can be expected that, as microsoft office has begun to introduce chatgpt function, and WPS office&amp;rsquo;s artificial intelligence module is still in the process of development, wps in this regard relative to Microsoft still exists a large gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My personal scoring of the above storage products and services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/how-to-design-a-network-storage-solution-for-family-photos/images/table-1024x677.webp&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This table is based entirely on individual usage and is intended to be used only as a reference for its analysis. For example, in terms of subsequent usage costs, since I have already purchased part of the cloud storage service for a long period of time, I do not need to pay additional fees for some time in the future. In addition, Synology NAS requires expenses for electricity, and my DS416slim consumes about 100 kWh of electricity per year, which is about 70 RMB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-final-choice-of-solution&#34;&gt;My final choice of solution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After analyzing the various storage products and services in use, I personally tend to make the following arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a. Continue to use Synology NAS as the main home storage device and use the photo function with limited external network transfer speed. I will purchase a new NAS product to replace it at an appropriate time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b. Give up using 115 Cloud, in fact I haven&amp;rsquo;t used the service for a few months and will not renew it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c. Discontinue the use of Huawei Cloud storage service until the whole family has updated their phones to Huawei phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d. Continue to use Onedrive as a backup option for family files and use its photo feature less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e. Abandon the use of Aliyun Cloud and Baidu Cloud. In such services where network file sharing is the main application scenario, it is okay to download network resources occasionally, but storing important family and personal files is too worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f. Continue to use China Mobile Cloud as a backup for family files and use its photo function appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;g. Continue to use WPS Cloud as the primary management method for Office documents until 2029, and then see what happens later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope my selection process will help you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I recently encountered a tricky problem when burning a CD. On the Lexus car CD player, the Chinese music label cannot be read. Looking back now, this problem may be unsolvable at the moment. Here is just a record of the solution process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;burning-program-selection&#34;&gt;Burning program selection.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before choosing to burn a CD, I searched for various burning tutorials in detail. The main difference is the choice of burning software. I have chosen Nero, Brunatonce and ImgBurn successively. Of the three, the first is old-fashioned paid software, and the second and third are free software. But Brunatonce has not been updated for more than ten years because of the developer, and the latest version stays at 0.99.5 in 2004. Although it can be used in XP compatibility mode on Windows 11, it still encounters inexplicable errors. In addition, it is said that among the three, Brunatonce is the software with the best low-speed recording effect, but since the current CD recorder has no low-speed recording, the starting point is above 10x, so it is of little significance. It is mainly recommended to use ImgBurn here. Although the program has not been updated for a long time, the developers have been answering questions online at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://forum.imgburn.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;http://forum.imgburn.com&lt;/a&gt;. Any questions can be answered in a short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;choose-the-recording-method&#34;&gt;Choose the recording method.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, the existing audio assets and the burning goals that need to be achieved. There are three main ways of distinguishing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a. Choice of audio CD and music CD&lt;/strong&gt;. Among them, audio CD refers to the lossless analog audio format *.cda reversed through the WAV format, which is non-digital music, and all CD records purchased by default are in this format. Music CD is a digital music format, and generally supports compressed music formats such as mp3/wma/aac. As far as 2022 is concerned, burning CDs generally pursues the former, and the effect of the latter will not be much better than listening to music via Bluetooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b. Selection of audio CD resources&lt;/strong&gt;. There are generally three music formats that can be burned as audio CDs: WAV, FLAC, and APE. And the music file of the same format has the difference of full track and split track, that is, a single CD is a whole file of about 400-700MB, or more than 10 single files of about 30-50MB. If it is downloaded from Ziyuan.com, most of the files are whole tracks, but on platforms such as QQ Music, only single tracks can be downloaded, and the entire CD cannot be downloaded as a file. It is generally recommended to choose the whole track file to burn. On the one hand, there is no need to worry about the insufficient capacity of the CD. On the other hand, the whole track file usually comes with a CUE file, or the format of ape can also be directly extracted from the CUE file through foobar2000. When burning a combination of self-selected songs, the main thing to be calculated is the CD capacity, which generally should not exceed 750MB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c. Audio CD-TEXT production&lt;/strong&gt;. As mentioned above, audio CD is an analog music format launched in 1982. At that time, CDs were the same as song tapes, and it was impossible to record song information. However, in 1995, Sony and Philips launched the CD-TEXT standard, which can embed CD-related track information at the beginning of the CD file. After that, Jeff Arnold developed the CUE Sheet file on the basis of CD-TEXT in 1997, and it has been followed by almost all Mainstream player support. Of course, this is the problem, whether it is the CD-TEXT standard_.cdt file, or follow-up_.cue files, in the Windows 95 era in the 1990s, almost never considered supporting Chinese natively. The former *.cdt file only supports ASCII (English letters), 8859 (English and European letters), MS-JIS (some Japanese characters) three character encodings, while the latter CUE only supports ANSI character encodings. Among them, the ANSI encoding is the most pitted. This encoding is automatically recognized as ASCII in North America, automatically converted to GB2312 in mainland China, and automatically converted to Shfit-JIS in Japan. That is, if an ANSI-encoded CUE file is made on a Windows computer set to the Chinese environment, it will be garbled when opened on a Windows computer under the English environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The biggest problem I encountered this time is that the Lexus CD player does not support the GB2312 mode ANSI in mainland China, so if the current cue file recording method is used, it will inevitably be garbled when encountering Chinese. Unless the cdt file editing mode is adopted, there are almost no ready-made cdt file editors on the Internet. Even though NERO can write cd-text files, it still uses the *.nra files developed by NERO to convert, and the actual test has no effect . The only way I can find out is to use Sony’s official cdt editor released in 1995 to edit, but if you want to insert Chinese, you can only edit in Windows 95 in the MS-JIS Japanese environment, with the help of 2500 A Chinese character commonly used in Japanese is realized. This method is a bit too frustrating. When I was discussing with the developer of ImgBrun, he also suggested that I should give up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;burning-process-ideas&#34;&gt;Burning process ideas.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I found garbled characters in the first recording, I searched all the information about CUE files in the Chinese circle, and came to three conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a. CUE must use ANSI format;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b. ANSI codes are different in different regions (as above &amp;ldquo;2.&amp;rdquo;);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;c. When the burned CD is played on the computer, unless a special plug-in is used, the effect of Chinese CD-TEXT cannot be seen generally. For example, in Foobar2000, it is displayed as garbled characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When burning for the second time, I chose to install a hyper-v virtual machine to test the cue file encoding problem in the English Windows 11 environment, and found three problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a. Chinese ANSI-encoded files are displayed as garbled characters in the English environment (as above &amp;ldquo;2.&amp;rdquo;);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;b. The UTF-8 encoding opened in Notepad on Windows 11 is not the same as the UTF-8 encoding opened in Windows XP Notepad. UTF-8 in XP corresponds to UTF-16 LE in Windows 11. It is more obvious in ImgBurn, only the cue file converted to UTF-16LE can be loaded normally in ImgBurn in English environment, otherwise it will be displayed as garbled characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;c. Although the CUE file encoded with UTF-16 LE can be recognized by ImgBurn, it is impossible to successfully engrave the CUE file with this encoding, because the CUE file itself only supports ANSI encoding, even if you choose to recognize UTF-16 in ImgBurn After LE encodes the file to force the output of ANSI, it is also displayed as garbled characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDs are a thing of the past. Nowadays, whether it is U disk, mobile phone Bluetooth or CarPlay, HiCar, CarLife and other connection modes, they are many times more convenient and easier to use than CDs. As a technology that can be called outdated, it is very difficult to seek technical support now. What is rare is that in the process of solving the problem, I still encountered a lot of useful information on the Internet. For example, I searched on Japanese websites and found hundreds of pages of discussions on how CD-TEXT supports Japanese in 2002. I saw developer 20 on ImgBurn. Year after year, I have been silently giving support to niche users. On the official websites of GNU and SONY, the links to technical documents from nearly 30 years ago are still well preserved. In comparison, it is really difficult to search for useful information on the Chinese Internet. Not to mention whether the links on the web pages 20 years ago can be opened normally, the normal search information is not right. No reason was found. For example, in many Chinese technical documents about CUE, it is shown that CD-text files support 8 languages, but which 8 languages are supported specifically, whether they contain Chinese codes, there is no place to find information, and the source of this statement is found through English searches. It is a technical manuscript on GNU, which is basically copied from the original text, but the technical manuscript on GNU gives an accurate source of evidence, that is, the official document on SONY DADC, from which it is found that the so-called 8 languages, except Japanese, other All are English, German, French and other European languages, excluding Chinese. Just stopped thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why 1000M fiber broadband, sometimes the speed is only 300M</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/why-1000m-fiber-broadband-sometimes-the-speed-is-only-300m/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/why-1000m-fiber-broadband-sometimes-the-speed-is-only-300m/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/why-1000m-fiber-broadband-sometimes-the-speed-is-only-300m/images/2023-04-15-155723-1.png" alt="Featured image of post Why 1000M fiber broadband, sometimes the speed is only 300M" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this question mainly because I searched all kinds of information on Baidu, and it was basically the same content. There were few articles that clarified this question. Most of them were nonsense. Sarcasm and personal attacks have no idea of solving the problem. Since I just encountered this problem, I will write a solution here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-why-is-the-speed-of-1000m-fiber-optic-broadband-only-300m&#34;&gt;1. Why is the speed of 1000M fiber optic broadband only 300M?**
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possible reasons: WAN TO LAN rate limit of the router; hardware acceleration is not enabled on the router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirmation of prerequisites: The network has been upgraded to 1000M optical fiber, the optical modem supports Gigabit output, and the router WAN and LAN ports both support 1000M Gigabit speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://Smallnetbuilder.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;http://Smallnetbuilder.com&lt;/a&gt;Query the router WAN TO LAN rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netgear r7000 WAN TO LAN rate: 931Mbps&lt;br&gt;
Netgear r6300v2 WAN TO LAN rate: 806Mbps&lt;br&gt;
ASUS ac68u WAN TO LAN rate: 754.5Mbps&lt;br&gt;
TP TP-LINK TGR1900 WAN TO LAN rate: 631Mbps&lt;br&gt;
Netgear r6100 WAN TO LAN rate: 93.1Mbps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other no-name routers may have insufficient hardware capabilities, and the WAN to LAN rate itself is low. It is not surprising that the wan port accesses 1000M and the LAN port outputs 300M.`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether to enable NAT hardware acceleration in the router settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the actual measurement, when the R6300V2 does not enable NAT hardware acceleration, the WAN port can only input 1000M, and the LAN port can only output 300M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the NAT hardware acceleration is turned on, the WAN port can input 1000M, and the LAN port can output 800M.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-why-is-the-speed-measurement-only-800m-or-920m-for-1000m-fiber-optic-broadband&#34;&gt;2. Why is the speed measurement only 800M or 920M for 1000M fiber optic broadband?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, on nga someone asked &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://ngabbs.com/read.php?tid=24003618&amp;amp;rand=981&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Telecom gigabit broadband speed measurement is only 800~900M&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;Many answers below basically miss the point. The core problem is that the maximum WAN to LAN rate of mainstream 1000M wifi6 routers is only about 920Mbps. You can check the relevant test results on the above website.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/a-more-economical-bluetooth-solution-for-everyday-use/images/2-4-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post A more economical Bluetooth solution for everyday use" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;With iPhone and Android canceling the 3.5mm audio interface one after another, Bluetooth devices ushered in a new round of explosion. Recently, I am playing Tencent’s new PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds: Stimulating the Battlefield. The foundation of years of fps is still there, and I can get started very quickly. Both 80% can enter the top 10. But this game has a very unfriendly problem - extremely fast power consumption, iPhone 7P 100% power, only open the default effect, the average power consumption per 20 minutes is about 20%-25%, full power is enough to play for more than 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/a-more-economical-bluetooth-solution-for-everyday-use/images/23-jpg.webp&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most basic requirement of FPS games is - headphones. But the current iPhone can no longer charge while playing games after using wired headsets, forcing users to upgrade to Bluetooth headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluetooth headsets are not just needed. Although airpods are good, the price/performance ratio is too low for my needs. Sports Bluetooth headsets already have sony sbh70, and there is also a rambler that has been in the dust for a long time, but after trying it, it is necessary to play FPS. For games with a strong sense of positioning, there is still a big gap between earplugs and fully-wrapped headphones. It just so happens that I have a SHP9500 that has been in the dust for a long time. Back then, it was known as the king of cost-effective earphones under 1,000 yuan, so I wanted to use it as a chicken earphone.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;367px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started looking for a bluetooth receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, when I was playing with monitor speakers, I paid attention to the field of Bluetooth receivers. At that time, I used i-audio’s Z2 as the sound source. I can’t remember the brand’s power amplifier and M-audio’s bx5a speakers to play. It just so happens that the player also has Bluetooth. , and it is said that it also supports the popular aptX protocol at that time, so I bought a Tianyi BTS-1 Bluetooth receiver online. However, it was later confirmed that the receiver was suspected of false advertising. After detailed packet capture tests, the receiver did not actually support aptX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/a-more-economical-bluetooth-solution-for-everyday-use/images/09_COWON_1-jpg.webp&#34;
	width=&#34;500&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;141&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;339px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of development, aptX has fallen from the altar, and the original CSR company has long been acquired by Qualcomm. It is estimated that most of the new Qualcomm chips can support aptX. However, aptX still maintains the original tradition, listing all authorized manufacturers and products on the aptx.com website in detail. After some searching, I found that Lulian, a domestic civilian brand, has many products listed, so I placed an order decisively.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose the two most compact ones - CM150 and CM124, a transmitter and a receiver, for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://hyruo.com/article/a-more-economical-bluetooth-solution-for-everyday-use/images/5-1024x313.webp&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;785px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the receiver is used on the front SHP9500 to transform the wired headset into a Bluetooth headset, while the transmitter is used on the Yamaha SLG200s, which can be easily connected to several Bluetooth speakers and headsets at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in fact, aptX is useless for the iPhone, because the iPhone only supports AAC and SBC, but the receiver + transmitter both support aptX, so you can easily connect the Yamaha SLG200s wirelessly. After all, aptX is already the pinnacle of Bluetooth. The default support order of these two receivers and transmitters of Greenlink is also aptX, AAC and SBC, so there is no need to worry about transmission standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in actual use, I still found a little problem, like the guitar, which uses Bluetooth to transmit the signal, and occasionally there will still be a little stuck, just like the Razer Fortress Spider that was upgraded in order to play games with the HTPC small steel cannon in the living room. Even with a touching price, it does not bring a smooth experience, and some sacrifices have to be made between portability and usability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dynamic clock icon on IOS7 is a rare dynamic icon in the IOS interface. Its design is indeed unique, but after careful observation, it is not difficult to find that the elements on this clock are indeed extremely simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On PPT, it is often necessary to use some eye-catching dynamic effects to enhance the taste of the entire PPT. The dynamic clock is a special element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture below is the clock style in IOS7, and the following is the imitation of this clock on the PPT.&lt;/p&gt;

What I imitated tonight is an arc-shaped circular color circle. Since the process is a bit cumbersome, I made a simple tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the imitation is a 12-segment ring, each segment is 30 degrees. For accurate realization, it needs to be calibrated with the help of a triangle. What needs to be paid attention to when making an isosceles triangle is to ensure that the apex is on the midline.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The relationship between work, study, life and BlackBerry</title>
        <link>https://hyruo.com/en/article/work-study-life-blackberry/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 12 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://hyruo.com/en/article/work-study-life-blackberry/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://hyruo.com/article/work-study-life-blackberry/images/2009814115601-jpg-1.webp" alt="Featured image of post The relationship between work, study, life and BlackBerry" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I started using BlackBerry in 2007, I can be regarded as a relatively experienced BlackBerry user in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been a player who prefers to play with emerging electronic products, but since the moment I bought a second-hand 7290 at a low price in 2007 due to the explosion of various cups, all this seems to be quietly changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more appropriate description would be: &amp;ldquo;Since using the BlackBerry, I don&amp;rsquo;t play with my mobile phone very much, which naturally improves the work efficiency of other activities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, getting this description is not fabricated out of thin air, but an epiphany when RT other people&amp;rsquo;s content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the following push is very real. Since I have used BlackBerry, if I talk about mobile phones, I will basically start with applications such as information communication and email. Compared with other platforms, games and entertainment functions are almost not too Many people care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important factor is what I read in &amp;ldquo;New Weekly&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xie Guorui, President of RIM (Blackberry) China&lt;/strong&gt;According to the slow development of BlackBerry in China these years and the frantic growth of Apple, it is concluded that:Young people use blackberries to appear mature, and &amp;ldquo;older business leaders&amp;rdquo; use apples to appear tender.He extended the reason why young people like to use BlackBerry as: &amp;ldquo;Workhard, playhard, to be a leader&amp;rdquo;. This is the slogan he made up for BlackBerry in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how relevant is Blackberry to work, study and life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my personal experience (I am not a white-collar worker at present, and it is rare for companies to open BES services. I just look at this issue from the role of a student or just entering the society),The biggest contribution of BlackBerry to work and study is that most people will not always play games or toss about things that don&amp;rsquo;t make much sense with their BlackBerry phones.BlackBerry plays a diligent tool role in users&amp;rsquo; lives. Most of its applications are based on improving work and study efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the course of my university studies, the translation and interpretation of various words, the direct reading of DOC/PDF files, mobile phone text reading and web browsing are the most core applications, and BlackBerry can often do all these tasks. And let me realize the needs of these information acquisitions in the best or fastest way. I don&amp;rsquo;t deny that other mobile phones can also implement similar applications, butWith the advantages of its full keyboard and various shortcut keys, BlackBerry brings these tools into full play to a very high level.You can set any program in the BlackBerry to the shortcut key to realize the most convenient tool operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a relatively closed smart operating platform, BlackBerry has obvious security and stability. For me, stability is the first to bear the brunt. In the course of many years of use, there is almost no impression of the phone crashing. The only unpleasant experience occurred in a very small number of domestic imperfect programs, which will cause the program itself to crash. This is undoubtedly due to the powerful &amp;ldquo;virtual machine&amp;rdquo; running of Blackberry ability. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is an appropriate description, in my impression,BlackBerry&amp;rsquo;s software platform is like a &amp;ldquo;virtual machine&amp;rdquo; like a &amp;ldquo;sandbox&amp;rdquo;, all third-party programs are running in such a &amp;ldquo;box&amp;rdquo;, even if the program in the box goes wrong, it will not affect the background system that operates the box. Coupled with BlackBerry&amp;rsquo;s own powerful multitasking and extremely powerful engineering mode, it can be said that the daily application of 99.99% will be based on a fairly stable state, unless the immature deletion of system files has caused problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blackberrymultitaskingIt is quite beneficial for daily work, because I never need to worry about the loss of previous work or other adverse consequences when a new task is not finished.&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://berrytimes.cn/2010/04/05/multi-task-of-blackberry-9700/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;test&lt;/a&gt;Keeping the phone running smoothly by running 57 mainstream applications on the BlackBerry 9700 at the same time is the best proof. Under normal circumstances, it is very common for individuals to use mobile phones to run 10-15 programs in the background at the same time, and itsFast switching between programsAlso commendable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the originator and model of the full keyboard,The effect of blackberry on text inputIn terms of technology, it has always been the leader in the industry. Although some models did not support Chinese input very well in the early days (especially the sad 7130 series), after the 5.0 system, the convenience of built-in Chinese pinyin input has been significantly improved. Of course , if you use Wubi, it is self-evident. There was a huge post with details&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://bbs.maxpda.com/thread-394426-1-1.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Compare&lt;/a&gt;I have passed the BlackBerry 8900 and E72, and I can say about the input of the mobile phone&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://bbs.maxpda.com/redirect.php?goto=findpost&amp;amp;ptid=394426&amp;amp;pid=7268949&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;watch here&lt;/a&gt;. It can be said that in terms of text input, BlackBerry has achieved the top position in the entire industry. It only needs a little familiarity with the input rules of BlackBerry to quickly experience the input pleasure similar to that of a PC keyboard. This is undoubtedly an important way to improve work efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mail, as an application that has been neglected by most Chinese for a long time, may be used as a substitute for occasional reading or when QQ is not enough to transmit so much information offline. But as a user who uses BlackBerry, in any case, he will gradually change his habits to adapt to the email life. For example, I do everything possible to search for various solutions to use mail to perform many originally complicated operations. For example, update blogs, microblogs, and website information by email, or use email to chat or communicate with others in depth.There is no doubt that in the field of mobile phone mail transmission, BlackBerry is the first in the entire industry, Even mobile phones such as Nokia, Motorola or Samsung have to purchase BlackBerry&amp;rsquo;s application technology authorization in the field of mail applications.Using email to update Wordpress and Weibo, and using email to subscribe to a variety of rich professional information is one of my favorite BlackBerry applications.Of course, I don&amp;rsquo;t rule out that other mobile phones can do the same, but there is no doubt that BlackBerry is the best. (I have to mention Berrymail here. As a non-profit email service, Titto and others have made outstanding contributions to domestic users who have not opened BIS/BES.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding software application, whether it can improve the efficiency of work and study is mainly reflected in the details. At the beginning, I was quite disdainful of the software/apps that come with BlackBerry. I always thought that the built-in schedule management, browser, notepad, alarm, automatic switch, and scene mode were too simple and poor. But after playing all kinds of applications, I found out that in fact, the built-in applications of BlackBerry, such as schedule management, although I was not used to it at the beginning, I always made mistakes in the time judgment, but after a period of time I got used to it. , I found that the schedule management thing is so useful, without it, I really don&amp;rsquo;t know that my Thunder offline file will expire on Wednesday afternoon this week, and Thursday is my grandma&amp;rsquo;s birthday, these rather trivial events in life and work. This is like the lethality of Itunes on Ipod users. When Apple users have to use itunes for music management, they all find that they can no longer do without Apple&amp;rsquo;s services, because the cost of transferring to other platforms is no longer a cost. For such a simple thing as software or hardware products, I have had this before&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://hyruo.com/2011/02/itunes.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt;Pass.BlackBerry&amp;rsquo;s built-in software applications, like the color of Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Logo, have a universal effect. It does not pursue uniqueness, but tries to design for users from a universal perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is the automatic switch setting. I once thought that I needed a highly liberal control software that can automatically shut down at 11:00 on Monday night, turn on at 7:00 on Tuesday morning, turn off at 12:30 on Tuesday night, and turn on at 9:00 on Wednesday morning. Of course, there are many such software, but unfortunately after using it for a while, I found that I don’t need this kind of service at all. Procedural deficiencies. In order to find fault with a piece of software, I actually forced myself to live an irregular life. Such absurd things actually happen often in life. When you fully perceive that your behavior is outrageous, it is the time to improve your life experience. Similarly, on the alarm clock, I also had this ridiculous idea. In fact, the BlackBerry alarm clock with systems above 5.0 is an extremely user-friendly product. The thoughtful pillow mode and exquisite UI design, rich functions and almost ubiquitous screen saver display are undoubtedly the development history of BlackBerry OS. a new height in .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackberry rarely entertains software/games, during my years of use, the entertainment game software that has been kept the longest is Nintaii (it seems to be cleared shortly after installation, but it is always installed on the mobile phone), Escape (not cleared so far) and Sudoku (now basically brushing records ) These three intellectual games almost accompany me most of the toilet time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game performance is the first factor for many young people to consider buying a mobile phone, but it is a pity that BlackBerry does not have as rich game resources as other platforms, which is directly related to its mobile phone user positioning.As a sign of business people/young people pretending to be mature, how decent is it if you still play games with your mobile phone all day long?Games are undoubtedly the factor that reduces productivity the most. Many of the high-quality games on the BlackBerry are related to intelligence, such as the above escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Originally, I planned to write some things about my work and study in this article, but I don’t know how to write it as Blackberry, FML&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to mobile phones and work and life, many people can’t help but think that their ownThe mobile phone must match your identity.How decent is it for a business person to shuttle between high-end office buildings with a three-card, three-standby counterfeit computer all day long?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brand is the first, and the style is the second. Of course, there is no need to say more about the brand of the BlackBerry. As for the appearance of the BlackBerry, different people have different opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time BlackBerry releases the so-called &amp;ldquo;spy photos&amp;rdquo; of a new model, people can&amp;rsquo;t help but want to scold their mother, why such an ugly thing came out again, but often as long as they see the real thing, they can&amp;rsquo;t help but marvel, it turns out that this TM is &amp;quot;&amp;quot; seeing is believing&amp;quot;! Perhaps for the first time, with Oriental wisdom,Blackberries are really ugly, especially when I first got the 7290, it was just a calculator with a larger screen, or an electronic dictionary like Wenquxing, which can be carried around the street all day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my 7290 broke down from the 4th floor, I bought the 7130, which looks less maverick Sure-type keyboard model (left), the key layout is similar to the familiar T9 key ( right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this BlackBerry, no matter how you look at it, it feels awkward~ Not to mention, the sales of BlackBerry with this key position are quite low.A BlackBerry without a full keyboard is like a kite with broken wings, without the ability to travel the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool appearance, is an important factor for many people to choose BlackBerry. It is generous and stable, which is in line with the psychological orientation of this group of people. It is a bit similar to the early Thinkpad. Therefore, BlackBerry is sometimes affectionately called &amp;ldquo;Little Black&amp;rdquo; by users just like Thinkpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of hardware, it must be mentioned thatblackberry screen, That was a shocking cry. In the market, there are basically no manufacturers who claim that their mobile phones only support 65,000 color screens, and this is one of the reasons why many users are hesitant when looking at the hardware specifications of BlackBerry. You are too outdated. Nokia launched a 260,000-color screen N years ago, and now 16 million colors are very popular. You are still wandering around with 65,000 colors&amp;hellip; It’s a pity that these people should have never experienced BlackBerry. The real phone, BlackBerry&amp;rsquo;s 65,000-color screen, basically surpasses other brands of mobile phones with the same level of resolution. For example, very few mobile phones can be viewed normally under the midday sun, but BlackBerry’s screen has always been able to do this (reflective screens such as 7290 needless to say, the stronger the external light, the clearer the view).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blackberry platformThe pressure on the hardware should be relatively smallYes, its applications and systems are not as resource-intensive as android or iphone. For example, I am using an 8900. From the engineering mode, I can see that the running memory (RAM) is only more than 30 MB, but it can still run many programs smoothly at the same time. , As for some newer models, the running ability of the BlackBerry program is even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I write here, it has nothing to do with life in general, and I digress quite far. I&amp;rsquo;ll stop here and talk about it next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dizzy in the afternoon, I stood in front of the bookshelf and spent more than half an hour flipping through Russell&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;China Question&amp;rdquo;, excerpted two pages,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to be convinced by Russell&amp;rsquo;s vision in 1922. Most of the Chinese problems he predicted happened later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And mostly impartial, to the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among them are a few comparative viewpoints, which I have known before, and let me deepen my impression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At that time, there was no big gap between China and the West in terms of morality and ethics. The biggest gap between China and the UK was science and technology;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Chinese learn from the West, most of them only care about morality, ethics, social value, etc., and pursue the pleasure of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joy of knowledge is considered by the Chinese as the door to wisdom;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westerners come to China only for three things: fighting wars, making money, and preaching;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of Japanese learning from the West is to enrich the country and strengthen the army;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese think that they are the best nation, and this point of view is shown to the world through the behavior of the Japanese,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the only exception to the &amp;ldquo;white-yellow-black&amp;rdquo; theory of the superiority and inferiority of races;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three major weaknesses of Chinese people: greed, cowardice, and indifference;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fragility of China&amp;rsquo;s coastal defense before the Sino-Japanese War of 1899-1895 was due to the corruption of Japanese interests;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China needs to save itself, not rely on foreigners!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is only a small part of my consciousness. This book still has a very friendly attitude towards China, but it is towards the West,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan is more criticized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many historical facts in it are now clear, its predictability is really worth studying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When each sunrise, we start a new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on the initial period, it can be described as both excitement and depression:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excitement is that most of the time when you encounter difficulties, you can find answers on Google and Bing;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frustrating thing is that even if I find the answer myself, I don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start. What&amp;rsquo;s more, due to excitement, confusion and depression, IIS5.1 occupied port 80 when dealing with the Apache component of XAMPP, so I uninstalled all system components by mistake, and reinstalled the computer as a result, which took a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning from &amp;ldquo;zero&amp;rdquo; is indeed difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember learning static webpage production, html language, C#, etc. when I was a freshman. I also downloaded tutorials for Invincible PhotoShop in private, but it seems that since the completion of the basic computer course exam, all the knowledge I have learned has been left behind. Haven&amp;rsquo;t felt anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I knew it, it was already four o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning, Brother Gou was still chatting with the girls, and my eyes were already hurting, recalling the time from the night before to now, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but sigh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20% time did 100% things, 80% time did meaningless things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ling Ling finally figured it out, and I have enough detours. For jobs like uploading websites, I first used the method of uploading extracurricular assignments in the computer course taught by teacher Guo Li when I was a freshman. I just click on the entire file Clip upload, but the wordpress installation program has not been uploaded in 40 minutes. Fortunately, I learned that DirectAdmin supports the compressed package in xxx.tar.gz format after being reminded by Wuhu Juanke at this time, which will also save me in the next work It took no less than a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;Never be arrogant in victory and not discouraged in defeat&amp;rdquo; is a more appropriate attitude towards life, but it is a pity that I fell under its skirt again..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems that occurred probably have the following aspects: 1. I don’t know what Mysql is, and I repeatedly make mistakes in filling in the database user, and I continue to find other versions of wp to upload without knowing it; 2. The level of E text is not high, and I don’t know enough about the options in the WP background Thorough, resulting in frequent errors in the settings, and had to reinstall if there were too many errors; 3. Still do not understand E text, set site redirection in DirectAdmin, causing an endless loop of address resolution, and reinstalled in desperation; 4. In the background option, set WordPress with blog They were all changed to the domain name address, resulting in an error on the page. In desperation, I had to continue to reinstall; 5. Unauthorized modification of .htaccess caused an endless loop again, and I had no choice but to reinstall; Upload it, but forget that you only need to upload the Chinese Sinicization plug-in, and then delete all of them&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the last moment, there was still a problem, but the reason was not directly because of myself, but because of an error in downloading the plug-in, which caused the background to completely crash&amp;hellip; (full of garbled characters)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason is that there is an error in the functions.php of EOS under themes (this plug-in was updated today, it is estimated that the author is different from the background program I use), fortunately, I have built xampp locally before, and downloaded and imported an earlier version of the EOS theme , open cutftp, overwrite functions.php, the world is finally peaceful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I want to explain that I am going to build this site as a blog type site for the time being, not only because of my respect and support for Zappao and the WordPress blog sharing plan, but also because I am limited to my level and can only rely on shared resources on the Internet for the time being. To build such a kind of website that is not very technical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing a domain name is a very difficult thing. The reason for choosing ifosu.com is because the abbreviation of my university is FOSU. I will introduce these in detail in the days to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it should be noted that this website temporarily uses the EOS theme recommended by ipack and made by sebastianrs. Due to time constraints, only akismet, Ozh&amp;rsquo; Admin Drop Down Menu and One Click Plugin Updater are installed in the plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After opening the message reply function, you only need to fill in the user name and email address to reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any comments or suggestions, I will try my best to modify them within my ability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
