    <section class="article-content">
    
    
    <p>Today, our Party issued the &ldquo;Decision of the Central Committee on Several Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Promoting the Rule of Law&rdquo;. The full text has more than 16,000 words. Due to time constraints, let&rsquo;s go section by section.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-is-the-paragraph-most-closely-related-to-personal-work">The first is the paragraph most closely related to personal work:
</h2><blockquote>
<p>The political and legal committee is the organizational form for the party committee to lead the political and legal work, and it must be persisted for a long time. Political and legal committees of party committees at all levels should focus their work on grasping the political direction, coordinating the functions of all parties, coordinating political and legal work, building political and legal teams, supervising the performance of duties in accordance with the law, creating a fair judicial environment, taking the lead in handling affairs according to the law, and ensuring the correct and unified implementation of the Constitution and laws . The party organizations of political and legal organs must establish and improve a system for reporting major matters to the party committee. Strengthen the party building of political and legal organs, and give full play to the political guarantee role of party organizations and the vanguard and exemplary role of party members in the construction of the rule of law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been folk rumors that since Master Kong stepped down, the status of the Political and Legal Committee has plummeted, and it will even be revoked. But the result was just the opposite. This time, the central government vigorously seized power, using the Political and Legal Committee as the starting point, and continued to firmly control the various political and legal departments. And the leadership level of the Political and Legal Committee was raised from the central government to be directly controlled by the top leader, so as to avoid the situation where power is out of control again. To a certain extent, it reflects the style of the hawks.</p>
<p>In the eyes of many scholars, the Political and Legal Committee is the source of the lack of separation between the party and the government, and the party&rsquo;s use of the party to disrupt the law. The Political and Legal Committee randomly guides the public prosecutors to handle cases and intervenes in individual cases. It is one of the chief culprits that deteriorate the legal environment and create unjust, false and wrong cases. But in fact, judging from my work experience in the courts, public security, judiciary, and political and legal committees of the political and legal system in recent years, these accusations by scholars or folks seem to be caused by a one-size-fits-all problem. In the words of a vice-president during the investigation of a certain court two days ago: &ldquo;Blindly directing cases and interfering in trials are things that can only be done by bumpkins in poor areas in the interior.&rdquo; &ldquo;Xiaohe, there are many cases like this in your hometown.&rdquo; &quot; &ldquo;How could this kind of thing happen in the Pearl River Delta region, it disappeared ten years ago.&rdquo; Roughness is not rough, I personally agree with the words of the vice president. Although his words are slightly ridiculed, they are consistent with my judgment on the overall situation of the rule of law - the allocation of legal resources between regions Seriously unbalanced and the level of rule of law varies greatly.</p>
<p>From my personal point of view, my current work is mainly to coordinate various political and legal agencies to solve practical difficulties, and focus on solving the difficulties of various agencies in handling cases in the field of people&rsquo;s livelihood that are of concern to the masses. Some of these problems involve multiple power departments, and we need to take the lead in coordination; some involve very professional work fields, and we need to study the direction of solving them; some involve major group interests, and we need to create a stable environment for handling cases; Some involve the fundamental interests of the masses, but they cannot be resolved through legal channels. We need to provide assistance and study preventive measures. These are real personal work issues at present, and the decision-making mentioned by the central government is consistent from theory to reality. But the problem is that not every region has the same political and legal environment as my region. Even within the Pearl River Delta, there are still many regions with various problems, and most of the work is in the form, the rule of law environment is not optimistic.</p>
<h2 id="just-like-these-two-paragraphs">Just like these two paragraphs:
</h2><blockquote>
<p>Implement the final trial and litigation termination system, implement the separation of appeals and interviews, and ensure that the parties exercise their appeal rights in accordance with the law. For appeals against effective judgments and decisions of judicial organs, the system of representation by lawyers shall be gradually implemented. Complainants who cannot afford a lawyer are included in the scope of legal aid.</p>
<p>Improve the linkage mechanism between administrative law enforcement and criminal justice, improve the standards and procedures for case transfer, establish information sharing, case notification, and case transfer systems for administrative law enforcement agencies, public security organs, procuratorial organs, and judicial organs, and resolutely overcome cases that cannot be transferred and cannot be transferred. , Punishment instead of punishment phenomenon, to achieve a seamless connection between administrative punishment and criminal punishment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;separation of lawsuits and interviews&rdquo; and &ldquo;connection of the two laws&rdquo; mentioned in the middle of these two paragraphs are one of the key tasks of our Political and Legal Committee this year. In the past 10 years, the complaint work has been in a hurry, brewing a large number of mass incidents, major cases, unjust, false and wrongly decided cases, which seriously damaged the credibility of the judiciary and restricted the development of a society ruled by law. The deepening of erroneous ideas such as lawsuits and haunting visits will restrict the development of the rule of law for a long time to come. The &ldquo;separation of complaints and visits&rdquo; is currently the first step in solving this major problem. Although staggering, since the pilot reform of &ldquo;separation of complaints and visits&rdquo; launched by the central government at the end of last year, my region has basically completed the separation of the field of complaints and complaints related to law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Combination of the two laws&rdquo; is an extremely professional field. Due to the unbalanced power development of the government in recent years, various administrative law enforcement powers are overflowing, but the supervision of administrative law enforcement powers is difficult. In the Peng Zhen era, the general supervision power of the procuratorate over administrative agencies was directly rejected, resulting in the long-term inability to obtain independent supervision in the field of administrative law enforcement, which led to a large number of &ldquo;substituting punishment for punishment&rdquo;, &ldquo;not punishing the guilty&rdquo;, and &ldquo;penal money&rdquo; in reality. transaction” phenomenon. It is almost impossible for the general supervision power to be taken back to the procuratorate, but the &ldquo;connection of the two laws&rdquo; is a very important supplementary method, that is, the procuratorate can supervise the law enforcement behavior of the administrative agency in the field of punishment, at least in key areas. The agency&rsquo;s law enforcement behavior has been monitored. But at the same time, &ldquo;connecting the two laws&rdquo; is currently an extremely difficult task. There are tens of millions of administrative law enforcement powers, and the units with law enforcement powers are more powerful than the other. It is completely impossible to rely on the procuratorate to do it alone. Therefore, the local political law The coordinating role played by the Commission is crucial. Some people may have doubts. It is enough for our procuratorate to exercise its procuratorial power in accordance with the law and handle cases independently. Why does Mao need you to coordinate with the Political and Legal Committee? The key point is that even if the procuratorate handles the case itself, in the professional field of &ldquo;connection of the two laws&rdquo;, there are not many prosecutors in China who can handle it. You still have to learn from the beginning, start from the beginning, and move forward step by step. What&rsquo;s more, even if prosecutors can handle cases, the public security has to learn it. The number of public security police is 100 times the number of prosecutors. What&rsquo;s more, there are millions of civil servants who have law enforcement power behind them. It takes several years for the &ldquo;Three Represents&rdquo;, how can it be possible to learn those things in the &ldquo;connection of the two laws&rdquo; in a short time. In the end, everyone doesn&rsquo;t learn, everyone doesn&rsquo;t practice, slack off each other, and the law does not blame the public. It is still the same as before, no progress at all.</p>
<h2 id="the-mode-of-cohesion-of-two-methods-is-as-follows">The mode of &ldquo;cohesion of two methods&rdquo; is as follows:
</h2><blockquote>
<p>If the illegal acts discovered by the administrative law enforcement agencies during law enforcement constitute a crime, the case shall be transferred to the public security. The public security examines the cases transferred by the administrative law enforcement agencies. If the conditions are not met, the cases will not be filed. If the cases meet the conditions, they will be investigated and then transferred to the procuratorate. The procuratorate receives the case transferred by the public security, examines and prosecutes it, does not prosecute if it does not meet the conditions, and initiates a public prosecution if it meets the conditions. The court judges and executes according to law.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="here-comes-the-problem-there-are-a-lot-of-difficult-problems-in-the-middle-tucao-mode">Here comes the problem, there are a lot of difficult problems in the middle: (Tucao mode)
</h2><blockquote>
<p>1. There are tens of thousands of administrative law enforcement powers, and the ability of administrative agencies is limited, so it may not be possible to find that administrative violations constitute crimes; 2. The procuratorate&rsquo;s ability is limited, and it may not be possible to find that the administrative punishment imposed by the administrative agency is &ldquo;replacing punishment with punishment&rdquo;; 3. The capacity of the administrative agency is limited, and it is almost impossible to collect criminal evidence (the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that it can only be done by political and legal agencies); 4. The capacity of the public security organs is limited, and cases with difficult to verify criminal clues or insufficient evidence can only be returned to the administrative organs; 5. When encountering a returned case, the administrative agency does not know how to deal with it. Transfer it, the police refused to accept it, don&rsquo;t transfer it, dereliction of duty. . . 6. The punishment of the administrative agency is fines, detaining certificates, detentions, etc. The evidence requirements are extremely simple, and you can be fined by sticking plasters; 7. The police want to arrest and convict people, and the evidence requirements are extremely strict. The punishment basis provided by your administrative agency is a pile of waste paper; 8. Why did the procuratorate go? The procuratorate didn&rsquo;t know what to do. You can&rsquo;t tell me that the procuratorate collects evidence by itself and then submits it to the police, and then let the police transfer it back, and then prosecute. 9. What about the courts? The courts still have headaches. The court still has a bunch of cases of refusal to enforce rulings and judgments waiting to be transferred to the police. My court has determined that this kid refuses to execute, which is already a crime. Whether you will be caught by the police or not. The police arrested him, whether the procuratorate will prosecute him or not, your court said he committed a crime, and my public security department is still making a fuss. Is this a lynching by default?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All in all, things like the independence of the judiciary are still difficult to achieve at present. The coordination function of the party committee still has a strong viability in the current country where the rule of man is still strong, but. . . . Not every local political and legal committee has the ability to promote these tasks. I hope they don&rsquo;t follow in the footsteps of &ldquo;urban management&rdquo;.</p>
