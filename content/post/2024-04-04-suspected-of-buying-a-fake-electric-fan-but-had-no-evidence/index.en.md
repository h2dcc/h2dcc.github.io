As the weather has been getting warmer recently, I chose an Airmate FA18 electric fan on the JD.com app. The promotional poster claimed that it is a high-quality, silent fan with AI voice function, but the product I received made me suspicious. It looks like a poorly made product. Firstly, the product logo has many signs of use, making it look like it has been used for a long time, which means it could be a second-hand product. In addition, I found many flaws in several parts of the electric fan, which made me question whether it is a fake product. Since I purchased it from the Airmate official flagship store on JD.com, according to my 20 years of online shopping experience, it is almost impossible for such a channel to sell fake products. Moreover, I have shopped online on JD.com nearly a thousand times and have never encountered such a problem. I sent these pictures to customer service, and they quickly arranged a return. Due to this extremely unpleasant shopping experience, I no longer want to continue buying products from this brand and immediately purchased another electric fan produced by Midea Electric.

In fact, the reason why I chose to buy an Airmate electric fan in the first place was because of my trust in their historical products. I had purchased two fans from this brand before and had good experiences with both. But after this time, I never want to buy this brand again. Moreover, Midea Electric is actually the largest local enterprise in our city, one of the Fortune Global 500 companies, and its products have always been trusted by consumers.
