Today, I had the great pleasure of attending the Foshan High-Quality Development and Rule of Law Forum. The theme of this forum was bankruptcy and the rule of law. The event featured two top experts in the field of bankruptcy law in China: Professor Li Shuguang from China University of Political Science and Law, and Professor Xu Yangguang from Renmin University of China. In addition, Judge Ding Haihu, an expert in bankruptcy adjudication from the High People's Court of Guangdong Province, was also invited to speak at the event.
